## 0. Executive Summary

As autonomous systems progress beyond task execution and adaptive optimization, a new frontier emerges: **self-evolving architecture**. These are systems that do not merely adjust behavior within fixed structures but instead **transform their own internal structure**—rewiring logic, composing new modules, and altering control pathways during runtime. Self-evolving systems exhibit architectural plasticity in response to internal needs, external context, or emergent opportunity.

This research note surveys the concept and practice of **self-evolving systems** across domains—from neuroevolution and NAS frameworks to anomaly-driven reconfiguration in cloud and network infrastructure. It examines how these systems detect when their architecture no longer suffices, generate structural alternatives, and validate or integrate those alternatives without external instruction.

The study outlines:

- The **distinction** between self-evolving and adjacent capabilities such as self-programming and self-improving;
- The **architectural requirements** for runtime structure modification;
- A survey of real-world systems that demonstrate **early forms of self-evolution**, including NAS pipelines, modular robotics, self-adaptive cloud services, and evolving training frameworks;
- The **mechanisms** (e.g., meta-learning, neuroevolution, test-time adaptation) that enable these systems to rewrite themselves;
- The **constraints and risks**—from safety violations to alignment drift—that govern self-evolving behavior;
- The implications for **autogenic intelligence**, where goal invention, behavior synthesis, and structural evolution converge.

As we approach systems capable of inventing new functions and restructuring themselves in real time, self-evolving intelligence may become the defining characteristic of the post-autonomous era. These systems do not just operate—they **become**.

## 1. Introduction

The evolution of intelligent systems has long been guided by the pursuit of autonomy—systems that can act, adapt, and improve without direct human intervention. Most current frameworks, from self-configuring networks to adaptive ML agents, operate within predefined structural bounds. They adjust parameters, optimize behavior, and even rewrite their goals, but they rarely challenge their own architecture.

**Self-evolving systems** mark a break from this paradigm. These are systems that can autonomously modify their own internal structure: composing new modules, replacing degraded subcomponents, rewiring data paths, or even shifting architectural patterns entirely. Where self-improving systems tune parameters, and self-programming systems alter behavior, self-evolving systems restructure themselves.

This ability introduces a new class of machine intelligence—systems that:
- Detect inadequacies in their structural design,
- Hypothesize new architectures based on goals or performance,
- Integrate or mutate components dynamically in response to evolving contexts.

Such systems appear in many forms:
- Neural networks that evolve their topology during learning (NEAT, HyperNEAT),
- AutoML systems that modify their own training pipelines in response to drift,
- Cloud services that rewire service graphs based on failure or opportunity,
- Runtime agents that restructure control logic under test-time adaptation.

These systems are not speculative—they are already emerging at the edge of deployment, and their capabilities challenge traditional notions of verification, governance, and explainability.

This research note develops a structured view of self-evolving systems by:
- Clarifying the core concept and how it differs from related capabilities,
- Analyzing the architectural and operational requirements for runtime evolution,
- Surveying real-world or experimental systems across AI, network, and cloud domains,
- Identifying enabling mechanisms, open challenges, and theoretical implications.

Where adaptive systems survive, self-evolving systems **transform**. They do not merely continue functioning—they redefine what they are. And in doing so, they foreshadow the next leap in machine autonomy: systems that can re-invent themselves.

### 2.1 What Is Self-Evolving?

A **self-evolving system** is an autonomous system capable of modifying its own internal structure during operation. This includes the ability to:

- Add, remove, or replace functional components (e.g., modules, services, model blocks),
- Reconfigure data pathways or control logic,
- Adjust its own architectural topology to meet performance, safety, or functional goals.

Unlike systems that merely re-tune parameters or retrain within a fixed configuration, self-evolving systems perform **runtime structural transformation**. The unit of change is not behavior but **architecture**.

#### Core Characteristics

1. **Autonomous Structural Adaptation**  
   Evolution is initiated and executed by the system itself, without external redesign or reprogramming.

2. **Context-Aware Reconfiguration**  
   Structural change is motivated by performance degradation, concept drift, novelty detection, or strategic foresight—not random mutation.

3. **Persistent, Operable Transformation**  
   Changes are persistent across cycles, with the evolved architecture becoming the new operational baseline.

4. **Generative Capacity**  
   The system must possess or access mechanisms for generating new configurations (e.g., mutation logic, model stores, component warehouses).

#### Example Transformations

- Replacing a control module that consistently underperforms with a synthesized alternative,
- Rewiring data flow in response to newly discovered correlations or bottlenecks,
- Integrating a new processing path (e.g., for anomaly detection) discovered through reasoning or interaction,
- Merging learned substructures from separate models to improve generalization or capacity.

#### Not Just Evolutionary Computation

While techniques like neuroevolution or genetic programming are often used, self-evolving systems are not limited to population-based methods. What defines them is the **intentional structural modulation during execution**—a closed-loop process that includes:

- **Sensing** when change is needed,
- **Generating** possible structural variants,
- **Evaluating** them in context,
- **Committing** viable transformations to the live system.

#### Why It Matters

Structure constrains behavior. A system that can alter its own structure can:

- Expand its expressive capacity,
- Shift its function set,
- Escape from local optima in architecture space,
- And adapt to radically different environments.

Self-evolving systems therefore represent not just adaptive intelligence, but **transformational intelligence**—the capacity to become something new.

### 2.2 Difference from Self-Programming and Self-Improving

Self-evolving systems occupy a distinct space within the broader landscape of autonomous capabilities. To understand their unique role, it's essential to differentiate them from two closely related forms of machine autonomy: **self-programming** and **self-improving**.

#### Self-Improving Systems
A **self-improving system** adjusts its internal parameters or performance strategies to better meet predefined objectives. Typical examples include:

- Machine learning models that adapt weights during training,
- Reinforcement learning agents that tune policies through reward feedback,
- Autonomic systems that optimize resource usage (e.g., autoscaling cloud services).

**Key Feature**: The system operates within a fixed structure but improves its behavior over time.

> *Example*: A neural network using backpropagation to refine its parameters on a fixed topology.

---

#### Self-Programming Systems
A **self-programming system** generates or modifies executable logic in order to satisfy tasks or goals. This may include:

- Synthesizing new rules or code from specifications,
- Learning new behaviors through interaction or demonstration,
- Using LLMs to generate executable scripts or workflows on demand.

**Key Feature**: The system modifies or creates new behavior but retains the same structural scaffolding.

> *Example*: An agent that writes new code to access an unfamiliar API using existing execution tools.

---

#### Self-Evolving Systems
A **self-evolving system**, by contrast, modifies the **structure of the system itself**. It changes:

- How logic is organized and routed,
- What components exist and how they interact,
- The architectural topology and decision framework.

**Key Feature**: The system redesigns its own architecture, not just its logic or parameters.

> *Example*: A service controller that identifies the need for distributed resilience, rewires its internal dependency graph, and replaces a single-point component with a modular replica-based structure.

---

#### Comparison Summary

| Capability       | Scope of Change        | Object of Change         | Structural Plasticity | Runtime Integration |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Self-Improving   | Parameter tuning       | Weights, thresholds       | ✗                      | ✅                  |
| Self-Programming | Logic generation       | Rules, policies, code     | ✗                      | ✅ / deferred       |
| Self-Evolving    | Architectural mutation | Modules, paths, topologies| ✅                      | ✅                  |

---

#### Why the Distinction Matters

- Self-improvement leads to **refinement**.
- Self-programming enables **flexibility**.
- Self-evolving supports **reinvention**.

Where the former two enhance competence within an existing design, the latter transforms the design itself. As systems face increasingly novel tasks, environments, and failure modes, **self-evolution provides the capability not just to act differently—but to become structurally different** in response.

It is a shift from optimization to transformation.

## 3. Architectural Dimensions of Self-Evolution

To understand how self-evolving systems function, we must look beyond behavior and examine the **architectural substrate**—the structural canvas on which behavior is defined, modified, and executed.

Self-evolving systems are distinguished by their ability to **modify their own architecture** during operation. This section breaks down the architectural dimensions that make such self-transformation possible, including:

- **Structural plasticity** — the capacity to reconfigure the system’s internal structure,
- **Meta-learning and rewriting** — mechanisms for detecting, generating, and selecting architectural alternatives,
- **Reflexive control reconfiguration** — the ability to modify the system’s own control mechanisms at runtime.

These dimensions together define how a system not only adapts its logic but **reshapes its form**.

---
### 3.1 Structural Plasticity

At the core of any self-evolving system lies a foundational property: **structural plasticity**—the system’s ability to modify, extend, or reorganize its own architecture during execution. This includes changes not only to logic or data, but to the relationships, boundaries, and topology of the system's components.

#### Definition

**Structural plasticity** is the capacity of a system to:
- Rewire control and data flows,
- Add or remove architectural modules,
- Alter the internal composition of functional units,
- Maintain coherence across architectural transitions.

Plasticity defines what kinds of structural change a system can perform and under what conditions those changes remain stable and operational.

#### Categories of Plasticity

1. **Topological Plasticity**
   - Reconfigures the shape of the system (e.g., adding/removing layers, paths, or agents).
   - Example: A neural network inserting skip connections during training to bypass vanishing gradients.

2. **Modular Plasticity**
   - Replaces or augments components at the module level.
   - Example: A service graph replacing a monolithic processor with a distributed microservice pattern.

3. **Hierarchical Plasticity**
   - Modifies the nesting or abstraction levels of components.
   - Example: Flattening a multi-tier control stack into a flatter reactive model for speed.

4. **Interaction Plasticity**
   - Rewires interfaces and communication paths between components.
   - Example: Rebinding telemetry consumers to different monitoring agents based on runtime feedback.

---

#### Design Implications

To support structural plasticity, a system must be designed with:

- **Reconfigurable interfaces** – allowing flexible binding between parts.
- **Loose coupling** – minimizing hardcoded dependencies across modules.
- **Dynamic registration or discovery** – enabling runtime composition (e.g., plugin frameworks, service registries).
- **Internal meta-models** – representing architecture as manipulable data.

Plasticity is **not the same as brittleness**. True structural plasticity allows change while preserving system coherence and purpose. It provides the substrate on which self-evolution operates.

---

#### Examples in Practice

- **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**: Evolves neural networks by adding nodes and connections during learning.
- **Kubernetes with dynamic sidecars**: Injects or removes services at runtime to support evolving telemetry or resilience functions.
- **Self-adaptive robotics**: Systems that rewire sensor-motor pathways in response to limb loss or configuration damage.

---

#### The Cost of Inflexibility

Systems lacking plasticity cannot evolve. They can only adapt within rigid confines. As a result:
- Novel goals may become unreachable.
- Critical failures may become unrecoverable.
- The system cannot improve beyond its initial design assumptions.

Structural plasticity is not merely a feature—it is the **prerequisite for self-evolution**.

### 3.2 Meta-Learning and Rewriting

Structural plasticity provides the substrate, but **meta-learning** and **rewriting mechanisms** supply the intelligence that drives self-evolution. These components allow a system not just to change, but to determine **when**, **why**, and **how** it should restructure itself.

#### What is Meta-Learning?

Meta-learning, or “learning to learn,” refers to the system’s ability to modify its own learning process. In self-evolving systems, it extends to:

- **Evaluating the effectiveness of architectural decisions**,
- **Adapting learning strategies based on structural context**,
- **Triggering rewrites based on performance degradation, goal shifts, or novelty**.

This enables a feedback loop where the **architecture influences learning**, and **learning influences architecture**.

> *Example*: A NAS (Neural Architecture Search) agent uses performance metrics to evolve its search policy, altering not just what architectures it tests, but how it generates them.

---

#### Structural Rewriting

Rewriting refers to the process by which a system **transforms its architectural representation**. This can be:

- **Symbolic** (e.g., logic or rule-based transformations),
- **Graph-based** (e.g., mutation of computation graphs),
- **Differentiable** (e.g., DARTS-style soft architecture search),
- **Evolutionary** (e.g., crossover and mutation in structural populations).

In all cases, the system represents its structure in a manipulable form and applies transformations using **internal decision logic** or learned heuristics.

---

#### Triggers for Structural Rewriting

1. **Competence Collapse** – A module or behavior consistently underperforms or fails.
2. **Goal-Environment Mismatch** – The system’s architecture cannot satisfy a new goal or task.
3. **Structural Drift** – Feedback signals show divergence between expected and actual outcomes.
4. **Efficiency Collapse** – A resource-aware agent evolves new architectures under power, latency, or bandwidth constraints.

> *Example*: An autonomous drone detects that its visual inference module is failing under foggy conditions. It rewrites its sensing pipeline to fuse infrared and sonar instead.

---

#### Systems with Meta-Learning and Rewriting

- **ENAS (Efficient NAS)**: A controller learns to sample high-performing neural architectures by observing past outcomes.
- **SEAD (Self-Evolving Anomaly Detection)**: Continuously refines and replaces detection models based on concept drift.
- **M-STAR**: Adapts prompts, reward models, and reasoning structure during training, forming an evolving curriculum loop.

---

#### Key Insight

Meta-learning and rewriting shift self-evolution from a random or reactive process to a **strategic, self-guided process**. They allow the system to reason about its own architecture as an evolving hypothesis, continuously refined by interaction with the world.

This is what allows self-evolving systems to **improve their structure in context**, not just blindly mutate it.

### 3.3 Reflexive Control Reconfiguration

In the highest-functioning self-evolving systems, structural change does not occur in isolation. It is regulated by the system’s **own control logic**, which itself can become a target of evolution. This is the principle of **reflexive control reconfiguration**: systems that **restructure their own mechanisms of control**.

#### What Is Reflexive Control?

Reflexive control refers to a system’s ability to:
- Monitor its own decision-making logic,
- Evaluate the fitness or adequacy of its control policies,
- Replace, revise, or augment those policies at runtime.

This is not just learning what to do, but learning **how to decide what to do**, and, crucially, modifying **how those decisions are made**.

---

#### Why It Matters

Most autonomous systems rely on fixed control hierarchies:
- Top-down planners,
- Rule engines or FSMs,
- Reinforcement learning policies.

These systems may adapt behavior within those frameworks, but **cannot restructure the framework itself**. In contrast, self-evolving systems with reflexive control can:

- Switch between decision-making modes (e.g., reactive to deliberative),
- Recompose or fuse planners and policy modules,
- Delegate authority dynamically (e.g., spawning new control agents),
- Redistribute responsibilities across modular subsystems.

> *Example*: A modular factory control system observes bottlenecks in its coordination layer and autonomously replaces its centralized task allocator with a distributed, self-electing swarm coordinator.

---

#### Mechanisms for Reflexive Reconfiguration

1. **Controller Abstraction Layers**
   - Systems model control policies as composable, swappable units.
   - Enables localized upgrades without destabilizing the whole system.

2. **Dynamic Delegation**
   - Control is assigned or reassigned at runtime (e.g., via auctions, votes, or triggers).

3. **Meta-controllers**
   - Supervisory logic that governs when and how to alter internal control loops.
   - May be learned (e.g., meta-RL) or rule-based.

4. **Reentrant Architectures**
   - Control logic operates on representations that include itself—supporting self-inspection and transformation.

---

#### Systems That Demonstrate This Principle

- **Omega Architecture** (Goertzel et al.): Explicitly includes modules that can rewire the cognitive graph based on utility.
- **AutoML + Reinforcement Controllers**: Learn when to switch learning strategies or swap sub-learners.
- **LLM-based Tool Use Agents** (e.g., LMA³): Dynamically invoke or bypass reasoning steps based on task context.

---

#### Design Challenge

Allowing control reconfiguration introduces risk:
- Recursive loops must be contained,
- Changes must preserve operational continuity,
- Reconfigured control logic must be interpretable and reversible.

To manage this, many systems enforce **invariance guards**, **rollback channels**, or **bounded delegation scopes**.

---

#### From Adaptation to Agency

Reflexive control reconfiguration signals a shift toward **true agency**:
- The system decides not just what to do, but **how it decides**.
- It evaluates and evolves the very structures that guide its behavior.

This recursive self-design is a hallmark of **autogenic intelligence**—systems that reconfigure both function and governance, evolving not just what they are, but how they define themselves.

## 4. Survey of Real or Experimental Self-Evolving Systems

While the concept of self-evolving systems is theoretically rich, its practical instantiations remain limited but growing. This section surveys real-world or experimental systems across robotics, machine learning, cloud computing, and network automation that exhibit core aspects of self-evolution.

Each of these systems demonstrates at least one of the following:
- **Autonomous architectural adaptation**,
- **Runtime structural mutation**,
- **Meta-level control reconfiguration**, or
- **Closed-loop evolution of system components**.

Although many originate in research domains, several are transitioning into operational contexts—particularly in training systems, online service delivery, and anomaly detection. Together, these examples chart the emerging frontier of self-evolving architectures.

The survey is organized as follows:

- **4.1** Neuroevolution (NEAT, HyperNEAT, rtNEAT)  
- **4.2** AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS)  
- **4.3** Self-Evolving Cloud and Network Architectures  
- **4.4** SEAD and Runtime Anomaly-Based Evolution  
- **4.5** Self-Evolving Training Pipelines  

Each subsection details a representative system or class of systems, outlines its evolutionary mechanism, and identifies the specific form of structural change enabled.

### 4.1 Neuroevolution (NEAT, HyperNEAT, rtNEAT)

Neuroevolution refers to a family of techniques that evolve the structure and parameters of neural networks using evolutionary algorithms. These methods are among the earliest practical demonstrations of autonomous architectural change.

#### NEAT: NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

**NEAT**, introduced by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen (2002), evolves both the **topology** and **weights** of neural networks. Key innovations include:

- **Historical markings** to preserve gene lineage,
- **Speciation** to protect innovation,
- Gradual complexification through **node and connection mutation**.

This allows networks to start simple and grow in complexity **during training**, discovering novel architectures suited to the task.

> NEAT does not just optimize a fixed model—it constructs new models as part of learning.

#### HyperNEAT and Indirect Encoding

**HyperNEAT** extends NEAT by using a **Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN)** to indirectly encode large-scale neural architectures. This enables:

- Reuse of structural motifs,
- Generation of symmetric, modular, or repetitive topologies,
- Encoding of spatial relationships for domains like vision or robotics.

HyperNEAT shows that **structure can be evolved from abstract patterns**, rather than specified manually.

#### Real-Time NEAT (rtNEAT)

**rtNEAT** brings NEAT into online learning environments by evolving network structures **in real time**:

- Poor performers are removed during operation,
- New offspring replace them without interrupting service,
- Evolution becomes a **live background process**, not an offline phase.

This makes rtNEAT one of the first frameworks to support **continuous self-evolution in a running system**.

---

#### Relevance to Self-Evolving Architectures

| Feature                         | Supported in NEAT/Variants |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Topological mutation             | Yes                      |
| Modular recomposition            | Maybe (via HyperNEAT)          |
| Runtime evolution                | Yes (rtNEAT)                 |
| Meta-control over search         | Maybe (primitive speciation)   |
| Reflexive architectural logic    | No                       |

NEAT and its descendants demonstrate that:
- Architectural evolution can yield more expressive and efficient solutions,
- Runtime structure growth is viable,
- Evolutionary strategies can integrate with learning to support **lifelong adaptation**.

They remain a foundational influence on newer systems that aim to evolve beyond just weights or scripts, offering direct lineage to the concept of structural self-evolution.

### 4.2 AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

While neuroevolution frameworks like NEAT explore structural change through genetic mutation, the field of **AutoML** and **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** has broadened architectural adaptation into mainstream machine learning. These systems automate the design of neural networks, optimizing not just weights but the structure itself—often under real-world constraints.

#### What is NAS?

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a class of techniques that **automatically generate and evaluate neural network topologies**. A NAS system typically includes:

- A **search space** (the possible architectures),
- A **search strategy** (how to explore that space),
- A **performance estimator** (how to judge candidates).

NAS automates the architectural design loop, enabling structural adaptation driven by performance feedback.

---

#### Evolution-Based NAS

Some NAS systems use **evolutionary strategies** to mutate architectures over successive generations. Notable examples include:

- **SANE**: Symbiotic, Adaptive Neuro-Evolution uses co-evolution of neurons and connections.
- **NSGA-NAS**: Multi-objective evolution of architectures with respect to accuracy, latency, and memory.
- **EF-ENAS**: Evolutionary Federated NAS for distributed training with local adaptation.

These systems evolve not just one optimal model, but **populations of architectures** that survive based on multi-objective criteria.

---

#### Gradient-Based NAS and Online Adaptation

Other NAS frameworks leverage **differentiable search techniques**, such as:

- **DARTS** (Differentiable Architecture Search): Uses gradient descent to select architectural choices via soft weights.
- **ProxylessNAS**: Optimizes architectures under real-world latency constraints on edge devices.
- **Once-for-All (OFA)**: Trains a supernet from which subnets are selected at inference time based on resource constraints.

These methods support **structural adaptation during training or deployment**, including model pruning, subnet selection, and dynamic reconfiguration.

---

#### AutoML Systems with Self-Evolving Behavior

AutoML platforms like **Auto-Keras**, **Auto-sklearn**, and **VEGA** increasingly support:

- Online pipeline modification,
- Dynamic component replacement,
- Configuration mutation based on feedback from deployment environments.

Some integrate **Meta-Learning controllers** that adjust search behavior over time based on historical performance.

---

#### Summary: NAS and Self-Evolution

| Mechanism                          | Self-Evolving Property        |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Evolutionary NAS (e.g., NSGA-NAS) | Runtime mutation of topology  |
| Differentiable NAS (e.g., DARTS)  | Soft structural optimization  |
| AutoML (e.g., VEGA, OAML)         | Component-level replacement   |
| Edge-aware NAS (e.g., OFA)        | Context-driven model rewriting|

While many NAS systems operate offline, the trajectory is clear: **architectures can and should adapt over time**, especially under deployment constraints. AutoML and NAS have demonstrated that **automated structural evolution is not only feasible—it is becoming a standard design strategy** in modern AI systems.

### 4.3 Self-Evolving Cloud and Network Architectures

The concept of self-evolution has begun to emerge in the domains of **cloud computing** and **network systems**, where operational complexity, fault tolerance, and dynamic workloads demand systems that can restructure themselves in real time.

Although still in early stages, several architectural models and implementations support **runtime structural change**, often inspired by autonomic computing and self-adaptive systems.

---

#### Self-Evolving Computing Systems (Weyns et al.)

Weyns et al. propose a full architectural vision for **self-evolving computing systems**, combining:

- A runtime **monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE)** loop,
- A **warehouse of deployable modules**,
- An **evolution engine** that replaces or adds components in response to violations, performance drops, or emergent opportunities.

> *Example*: In a smart mobility scenario, the system detects that its current routing algorithm cannot handle a sudden spike in ride requests. It pulls a new traffic prediction module from its warehouse and rewires its decision graph to incorporate it on the fly.

This model reflects **real-time architectural evolution** governed by meta-control loops and anomaly awareness.

---

#### Autonomic Cloud Systems

Cloud orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenStack) have started to support **self-adaptive behaviors**, though most are confined to configuration-level changes. However, newer systems are emerging that exhibit architectural adaptation:

- **RAINBOW Framework**: Adapts microservice placement and communication patterns in response to SLA violations.
- **Self-learning autoscalers**: Use reinforcement learning to adjust resource graphs, not just replica counts.
- **Dynamic service injection**: Sidecars or mesh gateways are added at runtime to inject observability, security, or policy enforcement functions.

While these changes may appear superficial, they represent **early-stage self-evolution**—systems inserting new behaviors without manual redeployment or redesign.

---

#### Anomaly-Driven Rewiring

Some systems integrate **self-evolving anomaly detection** as the trigger for structural change:

- **SEAD** (Self-Evolving Anomaly Detection): Learns evolving detection strategies and restructures internal logic trees over time.
- **Dynamic Recomposer Agents**: Alter service graphs in response to detected performance degradation or behavioral anomalies.

These mechanisms couple observability with architectural plasticity, closing the loop between sensing and structural adaptation.

---

#### Autonomic Networking

Inspired by biological systems, autonomic networking research proposes:

- **Atomic function recomposition**,
- **Topology-aware reconfiguration**,
- **Distributed architecture morphing** to support survivability.

Though largely conceptual, these ideas anticipate the need for **runtime transformation of network functions and routing structures** as first-class capabilities.

---

#### Challenges and Constraints

| Constraint                 | Consideration                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Operational continuity     | Must preserve service availability     |
| Security boundaries        | Structural change must maintain trust  |
| Resource constraints       | Evolution must respect budgets         |
| Control loop safety        | Prevent runaway evolution              |

---

Self-evolving architectures in cloud and network domains offer a critical proving ground for **controlled, service-aware structural change**. These are not abstract systems—they operate under uptime guarantees, regulatory constraints, and real-world failure conditions.

Their emergence signals a shift: **from reactive orchestration to proactive structural adaptation**.

### 4.4 SEAD and Runtime Anomaly-Based Evolution

A compelling subclass of self-evolving systems centers on **runtime anomaly detection**, where systems evolve their internal logic and architecture in response to unexpected behavior. Among these, the **Self-Evolving Anomaly Detection (SEAD)** framework stands out as a concrete demonstration of autonomous structural adaptation.

---

#### SEAD: Self-Evolving Anomaly Detection

SEAD is designed to continuously update and restructure its anomaly detection logic in the face of:
- **Concept drift** (shifting statistical properties of data),
- **Emerging threat patterns** (e.g., new types of network intrusions),
- **Evolving operational contexts** (e.g., changes in workload, topology, or observability).

Key features include:

- **Online retraining** of detection models with streaming data,
- **Dynamic replacement** of underperforming components,
- **Evolutionary mutation** of feature sets, classifiers, and scoring pipelines,
- **Autonomous model selection** based on fitness evaluations and feedback loops.

> SEAD doesn’t just retrain models—it rewrites the logic and structure of its anomaly detection pipeline, including which models are used, how outputs are fused, and what features are considered.

---

#### Evolution Workflow

1. **Observation**: Monitor streaming inputs and behavior metrics.
2. **Trigger**: Detect performance degradation or pattern drift.
3. **Candidate Generation**: Create alternate configurations (e.g., via mutation, recombination).
4. **Selection**: Evaluate against current or historical benchmarks.
5. **Integration**: Replace or merge with the active pipeline.

This creates a **closed-loop structural evolution cycle**, where detection logic itself evolves in response to the environment it observes.

---

#### Application Contexts

- **Cybersecurity**: SEAD detects novel attack vectors not present during initial training, restructuring its models and detectors to respond in real time.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Systems evolve new pipelines for outlier detection as workloads change and new metrics become available.
- **Fault-Tolerant Robotics**: Behavior monitors evolve to detect and compensate for emergent degradation in actuators or sensors.

---

#### Architectural Relevance

SEAD illustrates several principles of self-evolving systems:

| Principle                     | Manifestation in SEAD                |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Structural plasticity        | Rewiring of model chains             |
| Meta-learning                | Fitness-based model selection        |
| Reflexive control            | Autonomous governance of updates     |
| Runtime mutation             | Live replacement of classifiers      |

---

While SEAD focuses on anomaly detection, its architecture serves as a blueprint for other domains:
- Any pipeline where **data distributions shift**,
- Any domain requiring **resilience to novelty**,
- Any system that must evolve **logic and structure, not just parameters**.

SEAD shows that self-evolution can be both **domain-specific** and **architecture-aware**—an adaptive scaffold that responds structurally to the unexpected.

### 4.5 Self-Evolving Training Pipelines

Beyond model structure and runtime logic, a growing class of systems are demonstrating **self-evolution within training pipelines** themselves. These pipelines go beyond retraining static architectures—they dynamically recompose their structure, mutate processing stages, and adapt end-to-end flows in response to feedback, drift, or goal shifts.

---

#### M-STAR: Self-Evolving Multimodal Reasoning

The **M-STAR** framework introduces self-evolution into large multimodal models through:
- **Self-reward modeling**: Internally generated reward functions evaluate training progress,
- **Prompt restructuring**: The system evolves how it conditions and organizes inputs,
- **Dynamic curriculum learning**: The model selects its own training paths based on evolving task utility.

These components form a closed-loop system in which **training objectives and architecture co-adapt**, guided by internal evaluation mechanisms rather than external supervision.

---

#### Online AutoML (OAML)

**OAML** systems represent a practical form of pipeline self-evolution, using:
- **Asynchronous genetic programming** to mutate training pipelines over time,
- **Streaming concept drift detection** to trigger recomposition,
- **Component-level repair and replacement** of preprocessors, feature encoders, and models.

> Rather than simply adapting hyperparameters, OAML adapts **entire processing pathways**.

---

#### Lale and Pipeline Combinators

The **Lale** framework introduces a compositional approach to AutoML pipelines using:
- **Functional combinators** to compose, split, and merge stages,
- A declarative representation of pipelines that supports search and runtime transformation.

This supports **dynamic recomposition** during AutoML search and execution, enabling pipelines to structurally evolve as new data or goals emerge.

---

#### Test-Time Neural Adaptation (RNA)

Some self-evolving behavior appears at **inference time**, where models adapt their own internal structure on the fly:
- The **RNA** system (ICCV 2023) modifies model internals at test-time using feedback loops,
- Structural rewiring compensates for domain shift or sensor failure,
- Results in performance improvements without retraining.

---

#### Summary: Self-Evolution in Training Infrastructure

| System         | Evolution Focus                | Mechanism                           |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| M-STAR         | Reward modeling, prompt design | Reinforcement + prompt evolution    |
| OAML           | Full pipeline mutation         | Evolutionary AutoML under drift     |
| Lale           | Compositional pipeline logic   | Declarative recomposition           |
| RNA            | Inference-time logic repair    | Feedback-driven adaptation          |

These systems illustrate that **training is not a fixed process**. Pipelines themselves can evolve—driven by performance signals, data shifts, or internal goal formulation.

They embody the principle that **self-evolution is not limited to architecture or control—but can extend to the entire learning process**.

## 5. Enabling Mechanisms

Self-evolving systems do not emerge from monolithic design. They are composed from a set of enabling mechanisms—technical, architectural, and algorithmic—that together allow for runtime structural change.

This section identifies the core mechanisms that make self-evolution possible across domains. These include:

- **5.1 Evolutionary Algorithms** for structural mutation and selection,
- **5.2 Online Architecture Mutation** through graph rewriting and modular reconfiguration,
- **5.3 Self-Reward and Meta-Control** to govern when and how evolution occurs.

Each mechanism represents a building block—individually useful, but collectively transformative. These enablers turn systems from static executors into **living architectures** that adapt not just their behavior, but their form.

### 5.1 Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) provide one of the most mature and generalizable foundations for self-evolving systems. These population-based search methods offer a natural mechanism for **structural mutation**, **selection**, and **refinement** over time.

#### Core Principle

EAs simulate biological evolution by maintaining a **population of candidate solutions** that evolve through:

- **Mutation** – introducing random structural changes,
- **Crossover** – recombining parts of existing solutions,
- **Selection** – choosing fitter individuals based on a fitness function.

This paradigm is highly compatible with self-evolving systems, where the “individuals” can be:

- Neural architectures,
- Processing pipelines,
- Control logic modules,
- Service graphs or system topologies.

---

#### Why Evolution Works for Self-Evolving Systems

1. **Exploratory Diversity**  
   Maintains a population of structurally diverse candidates, avoiding local minima.

2. **Black-box Compatibility**  
   Works even when internal gradients or differentiability are unavailable.

3. **Composable Representation**  
   Allows modular units to be swapped, merged, or mutated (e.g., layers, services, sensors).

4. **Fitness-Driven Adaptation**  
   Provides an objective basis for selecting structural changes that improve utility, resilience, or efficiency.

---

#### Applications in Practice

| Domain                  | Evolutionary Mechanism                             | Example System        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Neural Networks         | Node/connection mutation, speciation               | NEAT, HyperNEAT        |
| ML Pipelines            | Operator crossover, pipeline mutation              | OAML, Auto-Sklearn     |
| Cloud Topologies        | Service graph mutation, function crossover         | RAINBOW, SANE-inspired |
| Anomaly Detection       | Tree recomposition, detector gene mutation         | SEAD                   |
| Robotics / Embodiment   | Morphological crossover, control structure mutation| Evolutionary robotics  |

---

#### Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge                         | Mitigation Technique                        |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Structural bloating              | Complexity penalties, regularization        |
| Premature convergence            | Speciation, novelty search, elitism         |
| Runtime disruption               | Hot-swapping with shadow modules            |
| Validation cost (fitness evals)  | Surrogate modeling, distributed evaluation  |

---

#### Toward Continuous Evolution

Many systems now embed evolutionary search directly into runtime operation:
- **rtNEAT** maintains a live population of network architectures,
- **AutoML controllers** evolve pipelines as data streams evolve,
- **Modular agents** self-select mutations based on performance feedback.

In such systems, evolution is no longer a **preprocessing phase**—it is an intrinsic, ongoing process of **structural adaptation**.

---

Evolutionary algorithms are not just search tools—they are **architectural enablers**. They turn structure into a mutable, learnable, and selectable element of intelligent systems.

### 5.2 Online Architecture Mutation

Online architecture mutation refers to the real-time transformation of a system’s structural representation during operation. Unlike batch-designed models or offline compilation, these systems alter their form on-the-fly, enabling **continuous structural evolution**.

#### Definition

An online architecture mutation system supports:

- **Live structural updates** without requiring restarts or redeployment,
- **Granular control** over what units (layers, services, logic gates) can be added, removed, or rewired,
- **Safe mutation protocols** to preserve stability, coherence, and recoverability.

This mechanism is essential for runtime self-evolution, where architectural changes must occur while the system remains operational.

---

#### Mutation Targets

| Target                     | Mutation Type                              | Example                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Neural network layers      | Add/remove nodes or connections             | NEAT, DARTS              |
| Pipeline stages            | Swap preprocessors or models                | AutoML, OAML             |
| Microservices              | Inject sidecars, rebalance graph edges      | Kubernetes, Istio        |
| Control modules            | Reassign authority, replace logic unit      | SEAD, multi-agent systems|
| Internal data paths        | Reroute telemetry, update dependencies      | Observability pipelines  |

---

#### Mutation Strategies

1. **Rule-Based Mutation**  
   Predefined structural rules govern allowable changes (e.g., type constraints, dependency trees).

2. **Search-Based Mutation**  
   Evolutionary or reinforcement-based systems explore structural alternatives and select the best.

3. **Graph Rewriting Systems**  
   Architectural graphs are treated as mutable data structures, and rewritten using rewrite rules or pattern matching.

4. **Meta-Compilation**  
   Architectures are compiled from mutable source representations that can be dynamically regenerated.

---

#### Live Mutation Enablers

- **Hot-swapping components** with fallback or proxy models,
- **Shadow deployment** to test mutations before full activation,
- **Transactional changes** with rollback on failure,
- **State transfer protocols** to migrate running state across architectures.

> *Example*: In a running ML service, a failing anomaly detector is swapped out with a freshly trained alternative. The state is transferred, inference resumes, and the change is committed—all without service interruption.

---

#### Systems Supporting Online Mutation

- **rtNEAT**: Maintains and mutates architectures live in memory.
- **RAINBOW**: Adapts service layouts at runtime in response to policy violations.
- **AutoML pipelines**: Mutate feature encoders or models during ongoing execution under concept drift.
- **LLM+Tool agents**: Dynamically restructure tool-use logic based on reasoning loop outcomes.

---

#### Design Requirements

To support online mutation safely and effectively, systems must include:

- **Clear structural boundaries** (what can be changed and when),
- **Metadata describing dependencies and constraints**,
- **Execution environments with strong isolation and introspection**,
- **Controllers capable of evaluating mutation outcomes**.

---

Online architecture mutation is the **operational substrate** of self-evolving systems. It allows structures to adapt at runtime—preserving continuity while enabling transformation.

### 5.3 Self-Reward and Meta-Control

At the heart of any self-evolving system lies the question: **what guides change?** Self-reward and meta-control mechanisms provide the evaluative and regulatory logic that determines when, how, and why structural evolution should occur.

---

#### Self-Reward: Internally Generated Utility Signals

Self-reward refers to the system’s ability to generate and update its **own utility functions** based on experience, performance, and context. Unlike external reward signals (e.g., test accuracy), self-reward mechanisms:

- **Emerge from internal metrics**, such as task success, model confidence, or energy efficiency,
- **Adapt over time**, evolving with system goals or environmental conditions,
- **Guide architectural decisions**, influencing structural mutation or replacement.

> *Example*: In M-STAR, the system learns to score its own reasoning chains during multimodal inference. Poorly performing chains are pruned, and better chains become structural priors.

Self-reward turns performance evaluation into a **first-class internal function**, enabling closed-loop learning without hardcoded objectives.

---

#### Meta-Control: Controlling the Controllers

Meta-control governs the **process of control selection, update, and reconfiguration**. In self-evolving systems, this includes:

- Monitoring the performance of individual control strategies (e.g., planners, policies),
- Switching between strategies based on internal models of task context or success likelihood,
- Modifying the control architecture itself—replacing rule engines, spawning subcontrollers, or fusing logic paths.

Meta-control provides the **reflective layer** that oversees structural change, acting as:

- A decision layer for mutation selection,
- A constraint enforcer to ensure safe reconfiguration,
- A regulator for frequency and scope of change.

> *Example*: An AutoML agent may switch from a performance-optimized search strategy to a novelty-seeking strategy if it detects premature convergence across architectures.

---

#### Key Design Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reward introspection     | Internal scoring functions evolve based on history          |
| Policy arbitration       | Competing behaviors are evaluated and selected dynamically  |
| Structural confidence    | The system estimates how well a structure is expected to perform |
| Mutation gating          | Meta-control decides when structural change is allowed      |

---

#### Systems with Self-Reward or Meta-Control

- **M-STAR**: Uses self-generated reward models to guide reasoning and structural evolution.
- **SEAD**: Learns fitness of anomaly detectors to select which should evolve or be replaced.
- **LLM+Agents**: Switch prompting strategies and tool use logic based on self-evaluation of plan progress.
- **AutoML controllers**: Adjust search direction based on meta-performance trends (e.g., model diversity, loss decay).

---

#### Toward Goal-Directed Evolution

Without self-reward and meta-control, structural evolution risks becoming either:
- Randomized (inefficient), or
- Fragile (susceptible to overfitting or drift).

These mechanisms enable systems to **reason about their own structure**, using dynamic goals, internal diagnostics, and adaptive regulatory loops. In doing so, they transform evolution from a passive process into an **intent-driven transformation** guided by system-level understanding.

Self-evolving systems must not only mutate—they must **know when and why to evolve**.

## 6. Constraints and Risk Models

Self-evolving systems offer unprecedented adaptability, but they also pose unique risks. As systems gain the ability to alter their own structure and logic, they challenge traditional notions of safety, identity, explainability, and operational boundaries.

This section outlines the primary **constraints** that must govern self-evolving architectures, and introduces corresponding **risk models** to mitigate unintended consequences.

---

### 6.1 Safety, Identity, and Alignment

#### Safety
Structural change can introduce:
- Logic loops,
- Performance degradation,
- Security vulnerabilities,
- Unexpected side effects.

To contain this, systems require:
- **Safe mutation envelopes** (e.g., type, scope, or dependency constraints),
- **Fallback configurations** and rollback mechanisms,
- **Pre-commit simulation** or staging environments.

#### Identity
As systems evolve their structure, they risk losing continuity of:
- Purpose,
- Interface,
- Behavioral expectation.

Maintaining identity requires:
- **Architectural invariants** (e.g., core modules that must persist),
- **Semantic anchoring** (e.g., retention of goal definitions across versions),
- **Versioned self-models** that track structural evolution.

#### Alignment
Systems that evolve their own goals, control logic, or architecture may diverge from human intent. Alignment strategies include:
- Embedding human-in-the-loop checkpoints,
- Encoding utility functions that preserve intent envelopes,
- Using interpretable reward models.

> *Example*: A self-evolving network controller introduces a shortcut optimization that saves bandwidth but breaks a compliance policy—an outcome of misaligned reward incentives.

---

### 6.2 Rollback, Versioning, and Observability

#### Rollback
Systems must be able to undo faulty structural transformations. This includes:
- Snapshots of prior architectures,
- Fast path reversion logic,
- Monitoring to detect regression triggers.

#### Versioning
Just as software has version control, evolving systems need:
- **Structural versioning** (what changed and why),
- **Provenance metadata** for traceability,
- **Diff and merge models** for re-integrating alternate evolution paths.

#### Observability
To trust evolving systems, we must see how and why they change. Observability mechanisms include:
- **Architectural telemetry** (e.g., what modules are active),
- **Evolution logs** (e.g., mutation events, reward traces),
- **Behavioral shadowing** (run proposed structures in parallel for comparison).

---

### 6.3 Containment Boundaries

To prevent structural evolution from cascading into failure or unintended system-wide reconfiguration, boundaries must be enforced:

| Boundary Type        | Example Enforcement                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scope limits         | Only specific modules may evolve         |
| Frequency gating     | Structural updates occur at safe intervals |
| Dependency checks    | Evolved modules must satisfy constraints |
| Capability sandboxes | New structures operate under resource quotas |

Containment ensures that evolution remains **intent-aligned, bounded, and interpretable**—even as complexity increases.

---

### Toward Responsible Evolution

Unchecked structural self-modification can lead to instability or misbehavior. But overconstraining it stifles potential. The challenge is to design systems that:

- **Evolve with purpose**, not just variation,
- **Track and justify** every structural change,
- **Balance adaptability with accountability**.

Risk-aware self-evolving systems will require new formal tools, new design disciplines, and new assurances—but they are the price of building machines that grow.

## 7. Implications for Autogenic Intelligence

Self-evolving systems mark a turning point in the development of intelligent machines—not merely because they can change, but because they can **redefine themselves**. This capability is foundational to what we call **autogenic intelligence**: the capacity of a system to invent, synthesize, and adapt both its goals and its structure in pursuit of continued functionality and expansion.

---

### From Autonomy to Autogenesis

Traditional autonomous systems operate within predefined architectures and goal sets. Autogenic systems go further:
- They **restructure themselves** as needed,
- They **reconceptualize their purpose** through self-orienting goals,
- They exhibit **meta-level self-maintenance**—revising how they learn, adapt, and control.

Self-evolution is one of the necessary conditions for such behavior.

---

### Structural Evolution as a Foundation

Autogenic intelligence depends not only on intelligent behavior but on **behavior-generating architectures that can change**. Self-evolving systems contribute:

- **Reflexive adaptation**: Learning how to learn—and changing the learner.
- **Goal alignment and drift detection**: Modifying the structure to maintain mission coherence.
- **Long-horizon creativity**: Generating architectures that anticipate future needs or environments.

A self-evolving architecture is not fixed. It is a living hypothesis about what the system needs to be, constantly revised through operation and feedback.

---

### Synergies with Other Capabilities

Self-evolution complements and amplifies other traits of autogenic systems:

| Capability         | Role in Autogenic Intelligence                        | Self-Evolving Contribution                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Self-orienting     | Invent new goals and re-evaluate direction             | Adjust structure to support new goals            |
| Self-programming   | Generate executable logic or behaviors                 | Alter logic containers and composition strategies|
| Self-improving     | Refine performance using feedback                      | Replace degraded structures and try alternatives |
| Self-reflective    | Analyze internal decision-making and structure         | Trigger or veto structural change mechanisms     |

Together, these form the scaffold for agents that do not just adapt or react—but **become** something new.

---

### Toward Open-Ended Intelligence

Self-evolving systems open the door to **open-ended intelligence**—systems that:

- Invent new capabilities from limited seeds,
- Navigate unpredictable environments by rewriting themselves,
- Outgrow initial constraints and assumptions.

They blur the boundary between program and programmer, structure and behavior, tool and tool-user.

---

### Risks and Opportunities

The same traits that give rise to autogenic intelligence also pose serious design and governance questions:
- **How do we trace intent in systems that rewrite themselves?**
- **Can we guarantee safety in systems whose structure is fluid?**
- **What are the limits of self-transformation before the system becomes unrecognizable or unaccountable?**

Answers to these questions will determine whether self-evolving systems become tools of unprecedented creativity—or artifacts of catastrophic drift.

---

Self-evolving architectures are not a curiosity. They are a **convergent feature** of intelligent systems capable of surviving, adapting, and thriving in environments too complex for manual design.

They are the architecture of becoming.

## 8. Conclusion

Self-evolving systems represent a profound shift in how we design, understand, and interact with intelligent machines. Unlike traditional software or even adaptive AI, these systems possess the capacity to **reconfigure their own architecture**—rewriting not only what they do, but how they are built.

Across robotics, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and network automation, early exemplars of self-evolution are emerging. They evolve neural topologies, recompose service graphs, mutate control pipelines, and update anomaly detectors in real time. These systems embody structural plasticity, guided by internal feedback, meta-control, and self-generated reward.

But evolution is not without cost. It introduces new risks:
- **Loss of identity**, where a system becomes untraceable to its original form,
- **Failure of alignment**, where goals and behavior diverge from intent,
- **Instability**, where uncontrolled mutation disrupts service, safety, or oversight.

These risks must be addressed not by halting evolution, but by **governing it**. This means designing containers, guardrails, and observability layers that preserve interpretability and coherence even as structures change.

Self-evolving systems do not merely optimize. They **transform**. And in doing so, they unlock new forms of agency:
- Systems that create new solutions without human design,
- Architectures that learn how to learn better architectures,
- Machines that become more than the sum of their initial instructions.

They are not static tools. They are dynamic participants in their own ongoing development.

As such, self-evolving systems may be the first true glimpse of autogenic intelligence:  
**Not systems that are merely autonomous—but systems that invent who they are.**
