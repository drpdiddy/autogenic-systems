#  Executive Summary

This research note introduces a modular, minimalist architecture for **autogenic systems**—software systems capable of self-reflection, self-evolution, and goal invention. Designed for **system-of-systems environments**, the architecture enables interaction with other systems of varying autonomy levels (automated, autonomic, adaptive) while maintaining internal evolutionary capabilities.

The system is composed entirely of agents organized into seven functionally distinct subsystems: **Execution, Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Control, Self-Management,** and **Peering**. Each subsystem is implemented using only the **lowest-level agents required**: procedural for fixed logic, learning for adaptation, and recursive for self-programming and reflective reasoning.

Recursive agents are limited to only those subsystems where they are essential, following a design principle of **constrained recursion**. A fallback architecture ensures graceful operation even in the absence of recursive agents, allowing deployment in resource-constrained or safety-critical environments.

The architecture extends prior standards like **TM Forum IG1251** and **ETSI ENI 051** by introducing formal mechanisms for **agent factories**, **recursive reflection**, and **self-hosting control logic**. It is intended as both a theoretical model and a practical blueprint for implementing evolving, service-oriented, agent-based autonomous systems.

## 1. Introduction

As digital infrastructure becomes increasingly distributed, dynamic, and complex, the need for software systems that can manage, adapt, and evolve themselves has become critical. Traditional approaches to automation—rule-based scripts, static workflows, or reactive control loops—fail to meet the demands of environments where goals shift, contexts evolve, and systems must operate without constant human supervision.

This research note introduces a minimal and composable architectural framework for building **autogenic systems**: systems capable of self-reflection, self-programming, and self-evolution. These systems not only automate operational tasks, but also **invent new goals**, **generate new behavior**, and **restructure their own control logic** over time.

The model is based on a **service-oriented, agent-based architecture** in which all behavior is implemented by agents of three types:
- **Procedural agents**, which execute fixed logic
- **Learning agents**, which adapt to their environment
- **Recursive agents**, which reflect, reason, and evolve the system itself

These agents are organized into seven functional subsystems: **Execution**, **Monitoring**, **Analysis**, **Planning**, **Control**, **Self-Management**, and **Peering**. Each subsystem is implemented using only the **lowest-level agent types required** to support its functionality, following a strict design principle of minimality and modularity.

This work differs from existing frameworks such as **TMF IG1251** and **ETSI ENI 051** by introducing formal structures for agent factories, recursive self-management, and the progressive bootstrapping of autonomy. It also proposes a clear fallback model in which the system can operate without recursive agents, ensuring safe deployment in constrained or high-assurance environments.

The goal of this research is to offer both a theoretical foundation and a practical blueprint for building self-managing systems that can evolve their behavior and architecture over time—systems that are not merely autonomic, but autogenic.

## 2. Background and Context

The concept of system autonomy has evolved through multiple generations of software design. Early systems were **automated**—capable of executing predefined rules. These were followed by **autonomic systems**, able to reconfigure themselves within bounded conditions. More recent designs incorporate **adaptive learning**, allowing systems to tune behavior in response to observed feedback. But truly **autogenic systems**, capable of inventing goals, restructuring logic, and evolving control architectures, remain rare and poorly formalized.

### 2.1 Autonomy Levels

This research follows a progressive view of autonomy:

- **Automated**: Executes static procedures without feedback  
- **Autonomic**: Detects and corrects deviations via preconfigured control logic  
- **Adaptive**: Learns from experience and modifies parameters or behavior  
- **Autogenic**: Reflects on its own structure, invents goals, and evolves its logic recursively

Autogenic systems are characterized not only by what they do, but by **how they change what they do**—including their ability to alter their goals, roles, and internal control strategies.

### 2.2 Self-X Capabilities

To describe internal capabilities, this work adopts and extends the widely used **Self-X** taxonomy. Key capabilities include:

- **Self-monitoring**, **self-analysis**, **self-healing** (from autonomic systems)  
- **Self-learning**, **self-optimization**, **self-adaptation** (from adaptive systems)  
- **Self-reflection**, **self-programming**, **self-evolving**, **self-orienting** (unique to autogenic systems)

Each capability is implemented by agents and mapped to specific architectural subsystems.

### 2.3 Agent Typology

The system model relies on three agent types, defined by their cognitive and operational depth:

- **Procedural agents**: Follow fixed, non-adaptive logic  
- **Learning agents**: Adjust behavior based on environment or experience  
- **Recursive agents**: Reflect on other agents, invent new goals, and generate new logic

These agents are composable and minimal: complex behaviors emerge by assembling them into structured subsystems.

### 2.4 Standards Context

The model builds on, but extends beyond, established industry frameworks:
- **TM Forum IG1251/1252**: Provides a reference model for intent handling and service orchestration, but lacks structures for goal invention or agent generation.
- **ETSI ENI 051**: Introduces closed-loop AI for network intelligence, but stops short of defining recursive agents or agent-based self-evolution.
- **ITU-T FG-AN and Y.3000 Series**: Define high-level concepts for autonomous networks, without detailing mechanisms for agent-based evolution.

This research situates autogenic systems as the **next architectural leap**, integrating and extending the cognitive layers introduced by these standards.

## 3. Design Principles

The architecture of the autogenic system is driven by a commitment to minimality, composability, and autonomy. Its design reflects four core principles:

---

### 3.1 Use the Simplest Agent That Works

Each subsystem is implemented using only the **lowest-level agent type** required to fulfill its function:
- **Procedural agents** for fixed, repeatable logic
- **Learning agents** for adaptive behavior and tuning
- **Recursive agents** only where invention, reflection, or structural evolution is required

This constraint avoids unnecessary complexity and ensures that most of the system remains lightweight, explainable, and testable. Recursive agents are powerful but used sparingly.

---

### 3.2 Subsystems Are Modular, Agent-Based, and Isolated

Each subsystem—Execution, Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Control, Self-Management, and Peering—is implemented **entirely with agents**. These agents operate as services with well-defined responsibilities and communication paths. No subsystem requires access to internal logic or memory of another.

This ensures clear separation of concerns, easier upgrade paths, and support for distributed or federated deployment.

---

### 3.3 Bootstrapping Starts with Autonomic Behavior

The system is initially shipped with a **minimum viable agent set**, composed of procedural agents and supporting runtime infrastructure. This allows the system to perform basic self-management and fulfill service obligations in a deterministic, testable way.

The first **recursive agent** is either instantiated from a lightweight blueprint or synthesized dynamically via a recursive-capable engine (e.g., an embedded language model). This agent catalyzes the system’s capacity for self-evolution.

---

### 3.4 Fallback Is a First-Class Design Target

The architecture is designed to operate in **fallback mode** if recursive agents are unavailable. In this mode:
- Only procedural and learning agents are active
- Goal invention and self-programming are disabled
- The system maintains autonomic or adaptive behaviors

This ensures resilience in safety-critical or resource-constrained environments and supports progressive onboarding of higher autonomy levels.

---

These principles reflect a commitment to **engineering for autonomy, not complexity**. The goal is not to maximize intelligence in every subsystem, but to ensure that intelligence emerges only where and when it is needed.

## 4. Autogenic System Architecture

The autogenic system is structured into seven modular subsystems, each implemented entirely through agents. Together, these subsystems enable a full loop of observation, reasoning, adaptation, execution, and structural evolution. This architecture is service-based, agent-driven, and capable of interacting with other systems of varying autonomy levels.

Each subsystem plays a distinct role and is populated only with the simplest type of agent required to perform its function.

---

### 4.1 Execution Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Execution subsystem provides the core service functionality of the system. It interfaces with the environment or client systems and is responsible for performing concrete tasks, such as sensing, actuation, data processing, or orchestrating service flows.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Procedural** (default)  
- **Learning** (optional, for localized tuning)

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-configuration  
- Self-preservation  
- Partial self-adaptation (when learning agents are used)

**Functionalities:**  
- Run service-specific workflows or control loops  
- Execute commands issued by the Control subsystem  
- Maintain local service state and output events for monitoring  
- Tune internal parameters (optional, via learning agents)  
- Trigger fallbacks or retries when execution anomalies are detected

**Example Behaviors:**  
- A sensor agent sampling temperature at fixed intervals  
- A message router forwarding data between queues  
- A microcontroller task that adjusts motor speed based on PID feedback

The Execution subsystem is optimized for speed and stability. It does not plan, reflect, or learn beyond local adaptation. It is designed to operate reliably even in the absence of higher-level agents.

---

### 4.2 Monitoring Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Monitoring subsystem continuously observes the behavior of the Execution subsystem and the platform on which it runs. It is responsible for collecting, tagging, and emitting telemetry data, including metrics, events, and logs.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Procedural**

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-monitoring  
- Self-description

**Functionalities:**  
- Collect system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, throughput)  
- Observe agent outputs and status indicators  
- Emit telemetry data in standardized formats  
- Register health, configuration, and version metadata  
- Expose probe interfaces or respond to telemetry queries

**Example Behaviors:**  
- An agent that exports CPU utilization every 10 seconds  
- A probe that checks for agent liveness via heartbeat messages  
- A metric publisher that emits latency histograms to the Analysis subsystem

The Monitoring subsystem is passive and lightweight. It performs no learning or adaptation. Its role is to **observe faithfully and describe clearly**, enabling other subsystems—especially Analysis—to reason about system behavior.

---

### 4.3 Analysis Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Analysis subsystem interprets telemetry data from the Monitoring subsystem and converts it into insights, assessments, and hypotheses. It determines whether the system is meeting its goals, behaving anomalously, or exhibiting emerging trends.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Learning**

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-assessment  
- Self-learning  
- Self-description  
- Self-knowledge  
- Partial self-reflection (as an input to Planning)

**Functionalities:**  
- Classify system states as normal or anomalous  
- Detect performance degradation, faults, or policy violations  
- Compare observed behaviors to internal expectations or past baselines  
- Feed structured context to Planning agents  
- Store patterns or behaviors for future reuse or knowledge accumulation

**Example Behaviors:**  
- A classifier detecting memory leaks based on rolling metrics  
- A threshold-aware agent flagging SLA violations  
- A summarizer that generates “health snapshots” for planning modules

The Analysis subsystem enables the system to **understand itself** and **reason about its current condition**. While it learns and adapts, it does not decide what to do—that is the responsibility of Planning. It operates continuously and reacts quickly to shifts in behavior.

---

### 4.4 Planning Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Planning subsystem generates responses to observations and evolving goals. It produces adaptation strategies, instantiates new behaviors, and—in autogenic mode—can invent new goals, policies, or control structures.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Recursive**  
- (Optionally supported by **Learning** agents)

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-programming  
- Self-orienting  
- Self-governance  
- Self-healing  
- Self-adaptation  
- Self-organization (partial)

**Functionalities:**  
- Compose or revise plans based on input from Analysis  
- Propose service changes, reconfigurations, or new agent deployments  
- Simulate outcomes of potential actions (e.g., via digital twins)  
- Invent or decompose goals in response to shifting intent or context  
- Generate or modify agent blueprints or policies

**Example Behaviors:**  
- An agent generating a reconfiguration plan after detecting bottlenecks  
- A goal translator decomposing “minimize cost” into actionable service constraints  
- A recursive agent generating a new coordination protocol for a discovered peer

The Planning subsystem serves as the system’s **reasoning core**. It enables closed-loop autonomy and recursive adaptation. It is also the point at which **fallback boundaries** are enforced: if recursive agents are not available, planning is limited to predefined patterns or reactive heuristics.

---

### 4.5 Control Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Control subsystem enacts changes proposed by Planning. It applies configurations, triggers structural updates, enforces policies, and coordinates the timing and execution of service changes. It ensures that decisions become actions.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Procedural**  
- (Optionally **Learning** for adaptive enforcement)

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-configuration  
- Self-governance  
- Self-healing  
- Self-preservation  
- Self-protection

**Functionalities:**  
- Apply configuration changes to Execution agents or services  
- Enforce service and platform policies (e.g., security, QoS)  
- Trigger failover or degraded-mode transitions  
- Activate or deactivate agents and subsystems  
- Coordinate rollback or compensation plans if actions fail

**Example Behaviors:**  
- An agent reconfiguring a service graph in response to a new plan  
- A policy enforcer blocking unauthorized access to a protected service  
- A failover controller initiating a backup routing path after link failure

The Control subsystem translates intention into enforcement. It does not reason or evaluate—it acts. While typically procedural, it can use learning agents to tune timing, thresholds, or reliability strategies.

---

### 4.6 Self-Management Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Self-Management subsystem is responsible for the system’s internal evolution. It oversees the structure, capabilities, and autonomy level of the entire system. This includes modifying control hierarchies, updating internal blueprints, and restructuring the agent fabric as needed.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Recursive**

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-reflection  
- Self-programming  
- Self-evolving  
- Self-hosting  
- Self-adaptation  
- Self-preservation (structural)

**Functionalities:**  
- Monitor and evolve the runtime substrate (e.g., rebalancing agents, modifying control topologies)  
- Instantiate, revise, or retire subsystems and agent clusters  
- Upgrade internal reasoning mechanisms (e.g., swap out planning strategies)  
- Modify system-wide control policies or autonomy level boundaries  
- Govern agent lifecycles beyond simple instantiation

**Example Behaviors:**  
- A reflective agent determining that an obsolete analysis module should be retired and replaced  
- A recursive controller rewriting part of the agent coordination structure  
- An internal governance agent limiting the scope of recursive behaviors in a safety-critical context

The Self-Management subsystem is what makes the system autogenic. It is not merely responsive—it is **structurally self-aware**. It has the authority to reshape the internal system architecture, evolve its own agents, and adjust the complexity of its own control loop.

This subsystem only becomes active once the system has recursive capabilities. In fallback mode, its behavior is dormant or delegated to predefined routines.

---

### 4.7 Peering Subsystem

**Role:**  
The Peering subsystem enables the autogenic system to interact with external systems, services, or peers—especially those with their own degrees of autonomy. It supports discovery, classification, negotiation, and coordination across system boundaries.

**Agent Types:**  
- **Recursive**  
- (Optionally **Learning** for partner modeling)

**Self-X Capabilities:**  
- Self-organization  
- Self-orienting  
- Self-learning (external context)

**Functionalities:**  
- Discover neighboring systems and classify their autonomy level (e.g., automated, autonomic, adaptive)  
- Negotiate service agreements, shared goals, or policies  
- Adapt system behavior based on partner capabilities and constraints  
- Synchronize or delegate functions across multiple systems  
- Participate in federated decision-making or emergent coalition behaviors

**Example Behaviors:**  
- A recursive agent coordinating traffic handoff with an adaptive neighbor system  
- A negotiation agent revising service goals to align with an external policy framework  
- A learning agent adjusting its interaction strategy based on peer behavior over time

The Peering subsystem enables the system to function as part of a **larger distributed ecosystem**. It supports not only interoperability but **inter-autonomy**—dynamic relationships where systems influence and adapt to one another. Recursive agents are critical here, especially when goals are not static and must be harmonized on the fly.

---

## 5. Agent Lifecycle and Bootstrapping

Autogenic systems are built entirely from agents, but these agents themselves must be created, managed, and eventually retired. The system includes an implicit lifecycle framework for its own agents—one that is minimal at first, but evolves in complexity as the system matures.

---

### 5.1 Bootstrapping from Procedural Agents

The system begins with a **minimum viable set of agents**, typically procedural, that implement:
- Basic monitoring and telemetry  
- Fixed control responses to known states  
- Predefined service functions  
- Autonomic self-management routines (e.g., reboots, restarts, policy enforcement)

This bootstrapping set is sufficient to operate the system in **fallback mode**, which guarantees safe, stable behavior with no recursive reasoning or goal invention.

---

### 5.2 First Learning and Recursive Agents

Once operational, the system may begin to instantiate more advanced agents:
- **Learning agents** are introduced into the Analysis, Control, or Peering subsystems to enhance pattern detection and adaptive behavior.
- The **first recursive agent** may be:
  - Instantiated from a shipped blueprint (e.g., meta-control logic), or
  - Synthesized dynamically using a generative engine (e.g., a small embedded LLM)

This recursive agent becomes the **seed for autogenic behavior**—capable of modifying goals, planning logic, and spawning further agents.

---

### 5.3 Agent Evolution and Retirement

Over time, agents may be:
- **Replaced** if their logic becomes obsolete  
- **Specialized** to serve new subsystems or goals  
- **Decommissioned** if their functionality is no longer needed  
- **Upgraded** into composite structures (e.g., a procedural agent becomes part of a learning cluster)

The Self-Management subsystem governs these lifecycle transitions. It may track:
- Agent performance histories  
- Resource cost vs. utility  
- Emergent redundancies or architectural inefficiencies

In fully autogenic systems, even **agent generation policies themselves** may evolve.

---

### 5.4 Fallback and Recovery

If a recursive agent fails or is disabled, the system:
- Reverts to a **fallback mode** with fixed plans and reactive behavior  
- Suspends structural changes or goal invention  
- Maintains safe and consistent service delivery

This lifecycle structure ensures that the system can evolve while remaining stable, traceable, and restartable under adverse conditions.

## 6. System-of-Systems Role and Interfaces

Autogenic systems do not operate in isolation. They are designed to function within **system-of-systems (SoS) environments**, where individual systems vary widely in autonomy, complexity, and purpose. This section outlines the role of the autogenic system as both a service provider and a reflective peer.

---

### 6.1 Interacting with Other Systems

The autogenic system exposes services to external clients, which may include:
- **Automated systems** requiring predictable service execution
- **Autonomic systems** seeking adaptive coordination or metrics
- **Adaptive systems** requesting behavior synthesis or policy alignment
- **Other autogenic systems** negotiating goals, sharing intelligence, or forming coalitions

The system distinguishes peers via the **Peering subsystem**, which classifies capabilities and determines interaction strategies based on the peer’s autonomy level.

---

### 6.2 Service Interface Model

The Execution subsystem provides services via an **intent-based interface**, which allows clients to:
- Express desired outcomes (e.g., “minimize delay” or “optimize energy”)
- Query system capabilities and status
- Negotiate constraints or coordination terms

The Planning and Control subsystems translate intents into executable plans and enforce them via Execution.

---

### 6.3 Digital Twin as Interface Layer

A key feature of the system is a **Digital Twin environment**, embedded in the Planning and Self-Management subsystems. It acts as a sandbox for:
- Simulating proposed plans before execution
- Modeling environmental dynamics or external system behavior
- Safely testing evolved control strategies

The digital twin is implemented using agents that mirror and predict the behavior of both internal and external components. These agents may also be used to test recursive logic before deployment.

---

### 6.4 Internal vs. External Self-Management

The autogenic system manages:
- **The environment-facing Execution layer**, to fulfill service goals
- **Itself**, including its substrate, agents, and policies

These two control surfaces may be interdependent. The system can:
- Learn how to manage the services it provides
- Simultaneously learn how to manage its own reasoning architecture

This recursive layering supports not only closed-loop adaptation, but **meta-level evolution**, enabling the system to serve others while continuously evolving itself.

## 7. Comparison with Reference Architectures

The autogenic system architecture aligns with, but also extends, existing industry frameworks for autonomous systems. This section compares the proposed model to the most relevant standards: **TM Forum IG1251/1252** and **ETSI ENI 051**.

---

### 7.1 TM Forum IG1251: Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture

TMF IG1251 defines a layered controller architecture consisting of roles such as:
- **Intent Handler**
- **Service and Domain Orchestration Controllers**
- **Service and Domain Control Loop Controllers**
- **Network Function Controllers**

These map closely to elements of the autogenic system, but with key differences:

| IG1251 Controller Role              | Autogenic Mapping               | Difference |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Intent Handler                     | **Planning / Peering** (Recursive Agent) | Autogenic system adds goal invention and reflection |
| Service Orchestration Controller   | **Control** (Learning Agent)     | Autogenic system localizes enforcement and minimizes orchestration |
| Domain Control Loop Controller     | **Monitoring / Analysis / Control** | Similar in function, but implemented with agents |
| Network Function Controller        | **Execution** (Procedural Agent) | Direct alignment |

> **Key Extension**: The autogenic system introduces **recursive agents** and an explicit **Self-Management** subsystem, which are not present in IG1251.

---

### 7.2 ETSI ENI 051: Experiential Network Intelligence

ETSI ENI defines an AI-based closed-loop model including:
- Knowledge base
- Policy engine
- Analysis and inference
- Decision making
- Action enforcement

These components correspond to the **MAPE loop** in the autogenic system, particularly:
- **Analysis Subsystem** ← ENI Inference Engine  
- **Planning Subsystem** ← ENI Decision Engine  
- **Control Subsystem** ← ENI Action Interface  
- **Self-Management Subsystem** ← No equivalent in ENI

> **Key Extension**: The autogenic system integrates recursive reasoning, goal generation, and agent lifecycle evolution—capabilities not supported by the ENI model.

---

### 7.3 Summary of Extensions

The autogenic system introduces the following architectural advances over existing frameworks:
- **Recursive agents** capable of reflection and structural evolution
- **Agent factory logic** embedded in planning and self-management
- **Fallback modes** allowing operation in constrained environments
- **Digital twin integration** for reasoning, simulation, and testing
- **Explicit peering subsystem** for multi-system coordination and self-organization

These extensions aim to elevate the system from adaptive to autogenic, enabling it to invent, restructure, and evolve over time while participating in complex distributed ecosystems.

## 8. Limitations and Fallback Modes

While the autogenic architecture is designed to support evolving, self-reflective behavior, it is also constrained by practical considerations. This section outlines system limitations and the fallback modes that ensure continued operation when full autogenic capability is unavailable.

---

### 8.1 When Recursive Agents Are Absent

Recursive agents are responsible for:
- Goal invention and decomposition
- Agent generation and evolution
- Structural reflection and planning refinement

In scenarios where these agents are:
- Deliberately excluded (e.g. safety-critical deployments)
- Failed or disabled (e.g. crash or sandboxing policy)
- Not yet synthesized (e.g. early bootstrapping)

The system enters a **fallback mode** that limits or disables:
- Dynamic goal revision  
- System-wide structural change  
- Agent self-programming or blueprint generation

---

### 8.2 Subsystem Fallback Capabilities

| Subsystem         | Without Recursive Agents                  | Resulting Limitation                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Execution          | Procedural-only logic                    | No adaptive tuning or configuration invention |
| Monitoring         | Fully functional                         | No limitations                               |
| Analysis           | Learning-based assessment only           | No goal alignment or narrative synthesis     |
| Planning           | No goal invention, uses static templates | Plans are fixed or externally supplied       |
| Control            | Fully functional                         | Limited policy-driven enforcement            |
| Self-Management    | Inactive or passive                      | No system restructuring or agent evolution   |
| Peering            | Simple classification, no negotiation    | No inter-autonomy adaptation                 |

---

### 8.3 Deployment-Driven Constraint Scenarios

The fallback mode is especially useful in:
- **Embedded systems** with strict runtime constraints  
- **Regulated domains** (e.g., aviation, medical) where goal invention is not permitted  
- **Phased autonomy deployments**, where systems evolve over time from static → adaptive → autogenic

Fallback is not a failure mode—it is an intentional, composable operating mode. The system is designed to degrade **gracefully**, never attempting capabilities it cannot support under current constraints.

---

### 8.4 Design Implication

Every subsystem in the autogenic architecture can operate in the absence of recursive agents. The system does not require full reflection to function, but instead grows into it. This makes the architecture **future-compatible** while maintaining robustness in the present.

## 9. Future Work

This research note defines a minimal, composable architecture for autogenic systems. While it provides a complete conceptual and functional foundation, several areas remain open for future development, validation, and extension.

---

### 9.1 Validating Recursive Agent Behavior

Recursive agents introduce the potential for system-wide restructuring, goal invention, and meta-reasoning. Future work is needed to:
- Define safe execution constraints and containment mechanisms  
- Validate recursive agent behavior using formal methods or sandbox simulation  
- Explore approaches for recursive agent self-verification and rollback

---

### 9.2 Agent Factory Design Patterns

While agent generation is supported in principle, further work is needed to:
- Define modular agent factory blueprints  
- Support multi-agent composition and specialization  
- Automate lifecycle transitions from procedural → learning → recursive agents

This includes integrating generative engines, such as embedded language models or symbolic planners, into the self-management layer.

---

### 9.3 Distributed Recursive Coordination

The Peering subsystem introduces the challenge of multi-agent, multi-system recursive reasoning. Open areas include:
- Consensus and negotiation across autonomous systems  
- Cooperative or adversarial goal alignment  
- Secure propagation of recursive agent logic between systems

---

### 9.4 Runtime Governance and Guardrails

As systems evolve their own logic, mechanisms for runtime governance become critical:
- Runtime traceability and auditability of self-generated behavior  
- Containment domains for recursive experimentation  
- Ethical constraints or safety policies integrated into planning

This is particularly relevant in domains where autonomy must be constrained by human oversight or mission assurance.

---

### 9.5 Application Domains and Implementations

Initial prototypes may target domains such as:
- Edge intelligence for autonomous vehicles or fleets  
- Self-optimizing communication networks  
- Adaptive mission software in space or defense  
- Reflexive controllers in smart manufacturing

Implementations may build on service meshes, container fabrics, or event-driven runtimes that already support partial agent-like behavior.

---

### 9.6 Long-Term Vision: Autogenic Ecosystems

The architecture supports recursive behavior in a single system, but may eventually extend to **ecosystems of autogenic systems** that:
- Evolve coordination protocols  
- Share recursive agent blueprints  
- Form reflective federations for global goals

This raises questions of collective self-programming, distributed self-reflection, and meta-level policy evolution—all promising directions for autogenic intelligence at scale.

## Appendix A. Fallback Modes and Recursive Agent Impact

This appendix captures the behavior of each subsystem when recursive agents are not available and defines the operational limitations of the system in fallback mode.

| Subsystem         | Recursive Agent Role                 | Fallback Mode Behavior                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Execution         | None                                 | Fully functional (procedural logic only)         |
| Monitoring        | None                                 | Fully functional                                 |
| Analysis          | Enhances multi-factor assessment     | Limited to static or learning-based evaluation   |
| Planning          | Enables goal invention, blueprinting | Falls back to fixed templates or pre-authored plans |
| Control           | Optional tuning via reflection       | Executes plans, no meta-policy adjustments       |
| Self-Management   | Governs agent evolution              | Disabled; system cannot restructure itself       |
| Peering           | Enables inter-autonomy negotiation   | Classifies peers but does not adapt dynamically  |

## Appendix C. Agent Types and Functionalities by Subsystem

This appendix summarizes the type of agents used in each subsystem and their primary functional roles. It reflects the design principle that each subsystem should use the **lowest-level agents required** to perform its function.

| **Subsystem**     | **Agent Types Used**          | **Primary Functionalities**                                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**      | Procedural (default), optional Learning | Execute service logic, maintain system output, implement fixed behaviors |
| **Monitoring**     | Procedural                    | Collect telemetry, expose metadata, emit metrics and logs              |
| **Analysis**       | Learning                      | Detect anomalies, classify behavior, evaluate system state             |
| **Planning**       | Recursive, optional Learning  | Generate adaptation plans, invent goals, simulate outcomes             |
| **Control**        | Procedural, optional Learning | Enforce plans, apply changes, enforce policies                         |
| **Self-Management**| Recursive                     | Evolve agents, restructure system, modify control logic                |
| **Peering**        | Recursive, optional Learning  | Negotiate with external systems, align goals, coordinate behavior      |

This table complements the Self-X mapping and lifecycle descriptions by showing which kind of cognitive complexity is required per subsystem. It reinforces the system's ability to operate incrementally and remain grounded in fallback configurations.

## Appendix D. Metadata Mapping by Subsystem

Each subsystem consumes and/or produces specific types of metadata. This appendix maps the metadata categories to the seven core subsystems, based on their functional role.

| **Subsystem**     | **Primary Metadata Consumed**       | **Metadata Produced**                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**      | Configuration Metadata              | Runtime Data (Logs, Events, Metrics)        |
| **Monitoring**     | Observability Metadata              | Raw Telemetry, State Snapshots              |
| **Analysis**       | Observability, Behavioral Metadata  | Assessment Results, Anomaly Reports         |
| **Planning**       | Goals, Policies, Knowledge Metadata | Adaptation Plans, Proposed Goals            |
| **Control**        | Plans, Policy Metadata              | Actuation Records, Change Logs              |
| **Self-Management**| Structural, Control, Platform Metadata | Updated Blueprints, Agent Lifecycle Logs |
| **Peering**        | Partner Metadata, Contract Templates | Coordination Proposals, Negotiation Logs    |

> Note: Recursive agents are responsible for generating or evolving **goal**, **blueprint**, and **control logic metadata** within Planning and Self-Management.
