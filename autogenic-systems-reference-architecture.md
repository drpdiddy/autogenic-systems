## Executive Summary

This research note proposes a minimal and fully agentic architecture for autogenic systems—systems that manage both their environment and their own existence without human intervention. Unlike traditional autonomic or autonomous frameworks that retain external orchestrators, static policies, or human supervision, the architecture presented here is constructed exclusively from agents, each selected according to the lowest type required to fulfill its function: procedural, learning, or recursive.

Twelve functional subsystems are identified, each implemented as a dynamic cluster of agents. These subsystems enable self-configuration, self-healing, self-programming, and self-reflection—not only in relation to the system’s mission domain, but also with respect to its own runtime platform. The system includes an intent-driven substrate that can be controlled by agents declaratively, and a recursive self-management loop that allows the system to monitor and adapt the very platform on which it operates.

By enforcing the principle of minimal agent typing and eliminating all non-agentic logic from control loops, this architecture establishes a novel lower bound on what is necessary to build a fully autogenic system. It formalizes the distinction between control and substrate, redefines the structure of system modularity, and offers a recursive blueprint for self-evolving infrastructures. The result is not just a design pattern, but a conceptual framework for the next generation of closed-loop intelligent systems.

## 1. Introduction

The aspiration to build systems that operate without human oversight has driven decades of research in autonomic computing, self-managing networks, and artificial intelligence. While many frameworks claim autonomy, they remain anchored to orchestration logic, manual configuration layers, and embedded assumptions about external governance. These systems may be adaptive, but they are not independent. They may be automatic, but they are not self-determined.

This note proposes a shift: an architecture for **autogenic systems**—systems that not only control an external domain, but also manage, adapt, and evolve their own infrastructure. Crucially, the architecture is implemented **entirely through agents**, with no privileged controllers, scripts, or orchestration planes. Each subsystem is realized using the **simplest possible type of agent** capable of fulfilling its function: procedural, learning, or recursive.

The system described herein manages two systems simultaneously:
- An **external mission system**—such as a network, robotic fleet, or software environment
- The **platform runtime** it depends on for execution, communication, and persistence

Through recursive feedback loops, self-generated intent, and distributed agency, the autogenic system becomes **both operator and operating context**, controlling the world and the conditions of its own existence. This architecture represents a minimal, modular foundation for building systems that are **self-sufficient, self-reflective, and self-evolving**.

This architecture represents a minimal, modular foundation for building systems that are **self-sufficient, self-reflective, and self-evolving**.

## 2. Design Principles

The architecture proposed in this research note is guided by a strict set of design principles intended to ensure minimality, clarity, and recursive autonomy. These principles define both what the system includes and what it explicitly excludes.

### 2.1 Agent-Only Implementation
All functionality in the system is implemented using **agents**. There are no privileged control layers, no orchestration engines, and no static configuration logic. Every subsystem is a dynamic cluster of agents.

### 2.2 Minimal Agent Typing
Each subsystem is implemented using the **simplest type of agent necessary** to fulfill its function:
- **Procedural agents**: rule-based, stateless, or fixed-behavior logic
- **Learning agents**: adaptive agents that modify behavior through feedback
- **Recursive agents**: agents capable of introspection, code generation, or reflective behavior

There are no **assisted agents**—human-tuned, semi-autonomous units—because no human is assumed to be in the loop.

### 2.3 Dual Control: Self and World
The system is responsible for two domains:
- The **external system** it is designed to manage (e.g., infrastructure, environment, process)
- The **platform runtime** it depends on (e.g., message bus, execution fabric, storage)

This dual control architecture introduces a **recursive self-hosting loop**, where agents can declare intent that modifies the very substrate they run on.

### 2.4 Intent-Based Interfaces
All interactions—between agents, between agents and the platform, and between agents and the real world—are mediated through **intent-based interfaces**. These are declarative, policy-driven structures that specify **what** should be achieved, not **how**.

### 2.5 Functional Subsystem Clustering
System functionality is organized into **named subsystems**, each composed of one or more agents working collaboratively. These subsystems are **not hardcoded modules**, but runtime clusters grouped by function.

### 2.6 No Orchestration, No Scripts
There is no external orchestrator or imperative script layer. Control loops emerge from agent communication, shared memory, and intent declarations. All complexity emerges from the composition of simple agents—not from hand-coded plans.

### 2.7 Self-X Capability Scoping
Each subsystem is scoped to support one or more **self-X capabilities** (e.g., self-configuration, self-programming, self-healing). These capabilities emerge from agent behavior, not from system-wide magic.

Together, these principles produce a system that is **modular, evolvable, self-contained, and operationally recursive**—an autogenic system in the full sense of the term.

## 2.8 Simple and Composite Agents

The architecture distinguishes between two fundamental agent types based on complexity and composition, enabling modularity, scalability, and evolutionary growth.

### 1. Simple Agents
- Represented by **procedural agents**  
- Exhibit fixed, rule-based, or scripted behaviors  
- Typically stateless or maintain minimal state  
- Responsible for basic system functions such as sensing, actuation, and straightforward control tasks  
- Serve as the foundational building blocks of the system

### 2. Composite Agents
- Encompass **learning agents** and **recursive agents**  
- Constructed by composing multiple simple and/or composite agents  
- Possess adaptive, reflective, or generative capabilities  
- Capable of evolving internal logic, generating new agents, and inventing goals  
- Provide higher-order functionality through hierarchical organization and collaboration among simpler agents

---

### Implications

- Composite agents form **hierarchical structures** with nested layers of simpler agents  
- System complexity grows **only as necessary**, preserving efficiency at the base layer  
- Facilitates **clear modular separation of concerns**, enabling evolutionary design and runtime adaptability

This design principle grounds the system’s agent fabric in simplicity while allowing sophisticated autonomous behavior to emerge through composition.

## 2.9 Agent Lifecycle

The agent lifecycle defines the stages through which an agent progresses—from its initial conception to retirement—within the autogenic system. Understanding and managing this lifecycle is critical for sustaining long-term autonomy, adaptability, and evolution.

---

### Lifecycle Stages

1. **Conception**  
   - The agent’s goal, role, or function is identified or invented, either through external intent or internal recursive generation.

2. **Design**  
   - Agent structure, behavior, and policies are specified. This may involve generating blueprints, code, or parameterized templates by factory agents.

3. **Simulation (Digital Twin Evaluation)**  
   - The agent’s behavior and interaction plans are evaluated in a simulated environment composed of agent-based digital twins to ensure safety and effectiveness before deployment.

4. **Selection / Promotion**  
   - Among candidate agents, those that perform best in simulation or meet predefined criteria are selected for deployment.

5. **Deployment**  
   - The agent is instantiated within the live system, allocated resources, and integrated with discovery and communication subsystems.

6. **Operation**  
   - The agent performs its designated tasks, interacts with other agents and the external system, and collects runtime data.

7. **Reflection / Evaluation**  
   - Critic or meta-control agents assess the agent’s performance, goal alignment, and system impact, identifying needs for adaptation or replacement.

8. **Adaptation / Evolution**  
   - Based on evaluations, the agent may self-modify, update policies, or be replaced by newly generated agents from the agent factory.

9. **Retirement**  
   - Agents that are obsolete, faulty, or replaced are gracefully decommissioned, and their operational data is archived.

10. **Legacy Integration**  
    - Archived agent data, models, and experiences are retained in the knowledge base, providing a foundation for future agent generation and system learning.

---

### Key Features of the Lifecycle

- The lifecycle supports **recursive and autonomous evolution**; agents can be created and retired without human intervention.  
- **Digital twin evaluation** acts as a safety and quality gate before real-world impact.  
- Lifecycle stages are managed by distinct agent clusters specialized for conception, design, evaluation, and governance.  
- The system maintains **continuity of knowledge and experience** through legacy integration, enabling ongoing improvement.

---

Understanding and implementing this lifecycle is foundational for building robust, scalable autogenic systems capable of sustained autonomy and self-improvement.

## 2.10 System Bootstrapping with Basic Agents and Subsystems

An autogenic system must begin its existence with a minimal set of **foundational agents and subsystems**—a bootstrap core that enables subsequent autonomous growth, self-management, and evolution.

---

### Bootstrap Core Components

- **Discovery Subsystem Agents**  
  Enable initial service registration, presence detection, and agent lookup.

- **Communication Policy Agents**  
  Enforce baseline communication permissions and trust boundaries.

- **Execution and Control Agents**  
  Provide basic operational functionality to interface with the external system.

- **Monitoring and Observability Agents**  
  Collect essential telemetry to inform early decision-making.

- **Agent Lifecycle Management Agents**  
  Oversee initial agent health, replacement, and retirement policies.

- **Minimal Agent Factory Agents**  
  Provide basic capabilities to generate new procedural or learning agents.

## Minimum Viable Agent Set for System Initialization

To enable autonomous operation from the moment of deployment, the autogenic system is shipped with a **minimum viable set of agents** focused on autonomic management of the underlying substrate.

---

### 2.11 Characteristics of the Minimum Viable Agent Set

- Comprised primarily of **procedural agents**, ensuring **predictable, rule-based control** over the platform runtime.
- Provides foundational autonomic capabilities such as:
  - Resource monitoring and health checking
  - Basic lifecycle management (agent registration, failure detection, restarts)
  - Communication policy enforcement
  - Service discovery and runtime topology awareness
- Designed to operate **without learning or recursive capabilities** initially, to maximize stability and safety.
- Enables **self-management of the substrate** (execution environment, message bus, storage) autonomically, forming a solid base for gradual system evolution.

---

### Purpose and Benefits

- **Predictable startup behavior** ensures the platform remains reliable and secure during initial phases.
- Provides a **scaffold for more complex agent types** (learning and recursive) to be spawned and integrated safely.
- Supports gradual transition from **autonomic to autogenic** operation as the system bootstraps higher-order capabilities.

---

### Summary

Shipping the system with this minimal procedural agent core creates a stable, self-managing substrate that enables the full agent fabric to grow and evolve without external intervention or human configuration.

---

### Bootstrapping Process

1. The system is instantiated with this minimal agent core, configured via declarative intents.

2. These foundational agents establish the **communication fabric**, **discovery mechanisms**, and **runtime control** needed for growth.

3. Using their respective capabilities, bootstrap agents generate additional agents and subsystems, progressively expanding the system’s autonomous capabilities.

4. Recursive agents, once created, enable goal invention, policy evolution, and runtime reconfiguration—initiating true autogenic behavior.

---

### Importance of Minimal Bootstrap

- Keeps initial system complexity manageable.  
- Provides **safe operational envelope** for agent experimentation and evolution.  
- Ensures the system is **self-sufficient** from inception, without external orchestration or human intervention.

The bootstrap core serves as the **foundation for all future autonomy and evolution** within the system.

## 3. Agent Typology and Capability Boundaries

The architecture enforces a strict classification of agents based on their autonomy, learning capacity, and reflective depth. This section defines the agent types used in the system and the functional boundaries that govern their deployment.

### 3.1 Procedural Agents

**Definition**: Agents with fixed, rule-based behavior. They do not learn, adapt, or reason beyond their programmed logic.

**Usage**: Used for telemetry collection, simple control actions, static routing, and protocol translation.

**Capabilities**:
- Self-monitoring (via fixed thresholds or probes)
- Self-description (reporting identity or state)
- Stateless or event-driven behavior

**Limitations**: Cannot adapt to new inputs, invent goals, or modify internal logic.

---

### 3.2 Learning Agents

**Definition**: Agents capable of improving their behavior over time through feedback, reinforcement, or statistical inference.

**Usage**: Used in lifecycle management, experience storage, simulation, and adaptive control.

**Capabilities**:
- Self-configuration (adjust behavior based on performance)
- Self-optimization (refine actions via feedback)
- Self-healing (learn from failure conditions)
- Self-knowledge (build local models of task performance)

**Boundaries**: Learning is scoped to a task or environment. These agents do not invent goals or alter their own architecture.

---

### 3.3 Recursive Agents

**Definition**: Agents capable of introspection, reflection, code generation, or metacognitive evaluation of other agents or the system.

**Usage**: Used in critic subsystems, agent factories, and goal managers.

**Capabilities**:
- Self-programming (generate new agents or control logic)
- Self-reflection (reason about system behavior or performance)
- Self-orienting (invent or evaluate goals)
- Self-evolving (restructure subsystems, adapt runtime configuration)

**Boundaries**: Recursive agents are rare, high-complexity units. Their role is carefully scoped to limit runaway generation or destabilizing meta-loops.

---

### 3.4 Agent Boundary Enforcement

The architecture mandates that **no subsystem may escalate its agent type** beyond what is required. For example:
- A monitoring subsystem must use procedural agents, not learning agents.
- A control subsystem should use learning agents only if the environment is non-stationary.
- Recursive agents must be used only when reflective or generative functions are essential.

This constraint ensures **architectural clarity, safety, and explainability**, while minimizing unnecessary complexity or resource use.

---

This agent taxonomy provides the foundation for subsystem implementation. In the next section, we map this classification onto the twelve functional subsystems of the autogenic architecture.
## 4. Subsystem Architecture and Functional Clustering

In this architecture, a **subsystem** is a cluster of collaborating agents grouped by functional responsibility. Each subsystem is composed entirely of agents, and no subsystem contains non-agentic logic. Agents within each cluster are typed (procedural, learning, or recursive) according to the minimal complexity required to fulfill their role.

To support explainability, modularity, and reflective evolution, each subsystem is also aligned with a single **cognitive focus area**, such as execution, intent, or reflection. This one-to-one mapping ensures that responsibilities are clearly scoped and distributed across the system.

---

### 4.1 Subsystem Overview

| #  | Subsystem                        | Primary Role                                          | Agent Type(s)         | Cognitive Focus |
|----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1  | Execution and Control            | Executes plans and interacts with external systems     | Procedural / Learning  | Execution        |
| 2  | Real-World Interface             | Binds internal agents to sensors and actuators         | Procedural             | Execution (nested) |
| 3  | Monitoring and Observability     | Collects system and environmental telemetry            | Procedural             | Awareness        |
| 4  | Discovery Subsystem              | Enables agent registration, lookup, and clustering     | Procedural / Learning  | Awareness (nested) |
| 5  | Digital Twin Simulation          | Evaluates behavior in simulated environments           | Learning / Recursive   | Analysis         |
| 6  | Critic and Meta-Control          | Evaluates agents and enforces behavioral alignment     | Recursive              | Decision         |
| 7  | Communication Policy Subsystem   | Enforces communication permissions and trust zones     | Procedural / Learning  | Decision (nested) |
| 8  | Intent and Goal Management       | Interprets, decomposes, or invents system goals        | Recursive              | Intent           |
| 9  | Knowledge and Experience Base    | Stores models, histories, and structured experience     | Learning               | Experience       |
|10  | Platform Self-Management         | Monitors and reconfigures the runtime environment       | Learning / Recursive   | Evolution        |
|11  | Agent Factory                    | Synthesizes new agents, policies, or behaviors          | Recursive              | Invention        |
|12  | Agent Lifecycle Management       | Oversees agent deployment, replacement, and retirement | Learning               | Reflection       |

---

### 4.2 Subsystem Principles

- Each subsystem is implemented **entirely by agents**
- Each subsystem maps to **only one cognitive focus area**
- Supporting or infrastructural roles (like discovery or communication control) are **nested** under their primary cognitive function
- No subsystem has architectural privilege or orchestration control—**autonomy is distributed**

This structure enables the system to maintain **bounded complexity**, perform distributed cognition, and evolve modularly over time.

See **Appendix B** for a detailed breakdown of the subsystem-to-cognitive focus mapping.

## 5. Communication, Discovery, and Trust Control

A minimal autogenic system requires not only agent capabilities and subsystem boundaries, but also a robust mechanism for **governing how agents communicate**—with each other, with external systems, and with the platform itself. This section introduces two dedicated subsystems that together manage the communication fabric: the **Discovery Subsystem** and the **Communication Policy Subsystem**.

---

### 5.1 Discovery Subsystem

The Discovery Subsystem enables agents to **register**, **locate**, and **subscribe to** one another at runtime. Unlike a static service registry, discovery in this architecture is implemented by **agents** and adapts dynamically as agents are created, moved, or retired.

**Key Functions**:
- Registration of agent identity, role, and capabilities
- Query and match agents by intent, type, or declared purpose
- Subscription to availability or role-change events

**Agent Types**:  
- Procedural (for lookup, basic registration)  
- Learning (for adaptive routing, semantic capability matching)

**Enabled Self-X Capabilities**:
- Self-description
- Self-awareness
- Self-organization

This subsystem ensures that agent clusters remain **fluid, composable, and decentralized**, enabling the system to restructure itself at runtime.

---

### 5.2 Communication Policy Subsystem

While discovery enables connection, the Communication Policy Subsystem controls **who is allowed to talk to whom**. This includes:
- Inter-agent communication
- Access to external systems or APIs
- Submission of intents to the platform runtime

**Key Functions**:
- Authorization and trust boundary enforcement
- Intent-type filtering and scoping
- Topology adaptation based on role, zone, or policy
- Detection and mitigation of unintended or unsafe communication

**Agent Types**:  
- Procedural (for rule enforcement)  
- Learning (for adaptive policies or trust zone learning)

**Enabled Self-X Capabilities**:
- Self-protection
- Self-governance
- Self-adaptation

Together, these subsystems **bind the system together**, enabling agents to find, connect to, and collaborate with one another **safely and purposefully**, even as the system evolves.

In the next section, we shift focus to the **platform runtime**—the non-agentic substrate that hosts the agents—and explore how the autogenic system manages and adapts this environment through intent.

## 6. Platform Runtime and Self-Hosting Control

An autogenic system cannot function in isolation. It requires a substrate—a platform runtime—that provides basic execution, communication, and persistence capabilities. However, unlike traditional systems where the platform is static or externally managed, this architecture treats the platform as a **controllable environment**, governed by the system itself.

This section defines the role of the platform runtime and the agents responsible for managing it.

---

### 6.1 The Platform Runtime

The platform is a **non-agentic layer** that:
- Hosts and schedules agent execution
- Provides messaging, routing, and broadcast mechanisms
- Manages stateful storage and shared memory
- Exposes external I/O channels (sensors, APIs, actuators)
- Offers an **intent-based interface** for runtime control

The platform does **not** make decisions, enforce goals, or manage agents. It is **passive**, but **programmable** through declarative intents.

---

### 6.2 Platform Self-Management Subsystem

To manage this substrate, the system includes a **dedicated subsystem of agents** tasked with observing, evaluating, and adapting the platform itself. This introduces a **recursive control loop**: the system modifies the conditions of its own existence.

**Key Functions**:
- Monitoring platform health (latency, load, resource limits)
- Reconfiguring execution fabric, storage policies, or messaging layers
- Migrating agents, scaling resources, or altering platform topology
- Declaring platform intents to increase survivability or efficiency

**Agent Types**:
- Learning (for runtime modeling and drift detection)
- Recursive (for reflective adaptation or recovery)

**Enabled Self-X Capabilities**:
- Self-hosting
- Self-healing
- Self-restructuring
- Self-preservation

This subsystem closes the loop between control and substrate, enabling the system to **sustain and reshape the foundation it runs on**, without external intervention.

---

### 6.3 Dual Control Architecture

The system thus controls two layers:
- **The external world** (its mission domain)
- **Its own platform** (execution domain)

This duality is what transforms an autonomous system into an **autogenic system**—a system capable of both **living in** and **maintaining** its own operational universe.

In the next section, we compare this architecture to existing models and highlight its novel contributions.

## 7. Comparative Positioning and Implications

The proposed architecture introduces a set of capabilities and structural constraints that distinguish it from established paradigms in autonomous and autonomic system design. This section compares the autogenic system model to representative frameworks and outlines the practical and theoretical implications of its core principles.

---

### 7.1 Comparison to Existing Frameworks

| Framework / Model          | Comparison Summary |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **TM Forum Autonomous Networks (AN)** | AN defines levels of autonomy with increasing self-X capability, but retains centralized control structures, external policy managers, and orchestration tiers. This architecture eliminates those layers entirely, replacing them with agent clusters and internal goal generation. |
| **ETSI ENI (Experiential Networked Intelligence)** | ENI introduces AI-based adaptation loops but relies on policy feeds and external evaluation. In contrast, autogenic systems internalize evaluation (via critics) and generation (via factories), operating without external policies. |
| **Kubernetes / MAPE-K** | Kubernetes is autonomic, but not self-reflective or self-generative. It requires declarative input from human operators. MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) provides a useful control loop abstraction but does not define agentic implementations or recursive self-hosting. |
| **Cognitive Architectures (e.g., SOAR, ACT-R)** | These define internal reflective loops but are designed for cognitive modeling, not runtime infrastructure control. The autogenic model generalizes this concept into infrastructure-wide, goal-directed feedback control. |

---

### 7.2 Implications of an Agent-Only, Minimally Typed Architecture

- **No humans in the loop**: The system does not rely on external configuration, oversight, or approval. There are no assisted agents.
- **No static orchestration**: Control flow emerges from agent interactions and intent. There is no central orchestrator or plan executor.
- **Dynamic system composition**: Agents discover and cluster at runtime via declarative discovery and communication policy.
- **Recursive autonomy**: The system controls both its external environment and the infrastructure that enables its operation.
- **Bounded agent complexity**: Agent type is scoped to function. Complexity escalates only when necessary, avoiding over-design or runaway meta-loops.
- **Modular evolution**: Subsystems are composable, substitutable, and can evolve independently.

---

### 7.3 Conceptual Shift

This architecture defines a **lower bound** for fully autonomous, self-evolving systems. By reducing control complexity to composable, typed agents and elevating platform control to a first-class recursive loop, it offers a **simpler, safer, and more explainable alternative** to layered orchestration or hardwired intelligence.

In the next section, we outline open research questions and future directions for realizing and validating this architectural model in real-world systems.

## 8. Open Questions and Future Directions

While the proposed architecture defines a clear and minimal structure for autogenic systems, several theoretical and practical challenges remain. These open questions highlight opportunities for future research, prototyping, and validation.

---

### 8.1 When Should Agent Complexity Escalate?

A central tenet of this architecture is using the **simplest agent type required**. But what triggers an escalation from procedural to learning, or from learning to recursive?
- Can escalation thresholds be formalized?
- What metrics define insufficient behavior (e.g., adaptability failure, novel goal emergence)?
- Can agent complexity itself be learned or predicted?

---

### 8.2 How Should Recursive Agents Be Constrained?

Recursive agents can generate or replace other agents, including themselves. Without constraints, this may lead to:
- Runaway generation loops
- Loss of explainability
- Resource exhaustion

Future work must define **guardrails for reflective behavior**, such as:
- Limiting code generation scope
- Requiring evaluation via critics before execution
- Separating generation from deployment privileges

---

### 8.3 How Can the System Be Observed or Debugged?

A system with no human operators still needs to be interpretable and diagnosable. Open questions include:
- What interfaces allow passive inspection without intervention?
- Can reflective agents explain their decisions to external observers?
- How can digital twins be used to safely inspect alternative outcomes?

---

### 8.4 How Does Subsystem Evolution Impact Stability?

If each subsystem can evolve independently:
- How are inter-subsystem contracts maintained?
- Can discovery and communication policy isolate or sandbox experimental behavior?
- Is there a stable “core” that must remain fixed for continuity?

These questions are especially important in long-lived or mission-critical autogenic systems.

---

### 8.5 Can This Architecture Be Federated?

The current model assumes a single autogenic system. In real-world deployments:
- Can multiple autogenic systems coordinate, compete, or negotiate?
- How are authority, trust, and intent shared across systems?
- What happens when one system modifies the runtime of another?

---

### 8.6 Validation in Real-World Domains

To validate the architecture, future work should prototype autogenic systems in:
- Self-managing networks (e.g., L5+ TMF AN use cases)
- Adaptive cloud fabrics (e.g., recursive deployment via intent)
- Robotic fleets (e.g., self-inventing logistics agents)
- Smart factories (e.g., zero-touch digital twin planning)

Each deployment domain raises specific modeling, performance, and safety challenges.

---

These open areas suggest that while the architectural foundation is sound, much work remains to **implement, constrain, and verify** autogenic systems under real-world complexity.

## 9. Conclusion

This research note presents a minimal yet complete architecture for **autogenic systems**—systems capable of controlling both their external environment and the infrastructure on which they depend, without human intervention or orchestration. Built entirely from agents, each subsystem is implemented using only the simplest agent types required: procedural, learning, or recursive.

The architecture defines twelve functional subsystems, including dedicated layers for agent discovery, communication control, self-hosting, and self-programming. It introduces an explicit separation between the **control system** (the agent clusters) and the **platform runtime** (the passive substrate), while ensuring that the control system can adapt and reconfigure the runtime itself.

Unlike existing frameworks in network automation, cloud orchestration, or cognitive modeling, this architecture removes all privileged control logic and external policy dependencies. What remains is a clean, recursive structure in which control, adaptation, and evolution emerge from interaction among agents—guided by intent, constrained by policy, and observable through self-reflective loops.

This architecture is not simply a proposal for software design. It is a conceptual foundation for **truly self-sustaining, self-evolving infrastructures**. By lowering the minimum requirements for autonomy, and organizing complexity into modular, agent-based clusters, the autogenic system offers a powerful alternative to conventional automation: one that can invent, evaluate, and adapt itself—alongside the systems it manages.

Future work will focus on implementation models, domain-specific deployments, and safeguards for recursive autonomy. But the architectural core is established: **a minimal, agent-only system that governs both its function and its foundation**.

## Appendix A: Subsystem Categories by Functional Role

## Appendix B: Subsystem Mapping by Cognitive Focus (Exclusive Assignment)

Each subsystem in the autogenic architecture is aligned to **exactly one** of the nine cognitive focus areas, based on its dominant function. This ensures clear reasoning about responsibility, self-X capabilities, and evolutionary scope.

Supporting subsystems are **nested under their closest cognitive focus area** to preserve architectural coherence without ambiguity.

| **Cognitive Focus** | **Assigned Subsystem(s)**                                  | **Primary Role**                                          |

## Appendix C: Comparative Analysis of Reference Architectures

This appendix contrasts the proposed Autogenic System Architecture with two prominent reference models in autonomous system design: the **ITU-T Autonomous Networks (AN) Framework** and the **ETSI ENI 051 Agent-Based Architecture**. The comparison highlights architectural choices, control models, intent handling, cognition representation, and the role of autonomy.

### C.1 Comparison with ITU-T Autonomous Networks (AN) Framework

| **Dimension**                  | **Autogenic System Architecture**                             | **ITU-T AN Framework**                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architectural Core**        | Agents as universal primitives (typed: procedural to recursive)| Functional domains (Intent, Knowledge, Management, etc.)     |
| **Control Loops**             | Distributed agent clusters with reflective feedback            | Hierarchical, multi-domain closed control loops             |
| **Intent Processing**         | Intent is parsed, invented, and decomposed by recursive agents | Handled in Intent Domain and mapped to services via policies|
| **Lifecycle Management**      | Agent Lifecycle Subsystem (self-driven creation & retirement)  | External lifecycle orchestration and exposure               |
| **Self-X Scope**              | Emerges from typed agents across all subsystems                | Modeled across AN Levels (L0–L5), defined as system features |
| **Runtime Infrastructure**    | Explicitly self-managed by Platform Self-Management agents     | Implicit; infrastructure assumed to be external             |
| **Cognition Representation**  | Subsystems aligned to cognitive functions (e.g. Decision, Evolution)| Not formally modeled; inferred via functional domains   |
| **Digital Twin Role**         | Built-in agent-based simulation and feedback loop              | Mentioned as sandbox capability; not architecturally bound  |
| **Communication Governance**  | Dedicated Communication Policy Subsystem                       | Enforced through management domain, not first-class element |
| **Autonomy Levels**           | Emerges from capability distribution in agent types            | Defined explicitly by TMF AN Level classification           |
| **Human Involvement**         | None; no assisted agents or external supervision               | Required at L0–L2; optional at L3–L5                         |
| **Orchestration / Policies**  | Eliminated; replaced by recursive goal-based reasoning         | Central orchestration and policy enforcement modules        |

---

### C.2 Comparison with ETSI ENI 051 (Agent-Based Architecture)

| **Dimension**                  | **Autogenic System Architecture**                             | **ETSI ENI 051**                                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Units**              | Typed agents organized by cognitive function                   | Modular function blocks (Inference, Knowledge, Evaluation)  |
| **Cognition Model**           | Subsystem-aligned cognitive focus (Intent, Reflection, etc.)   | Inference-based cycle (Collect, Analyze, Reason, Act)       |
| **Agent Framework**           | Agents perform end-to-end behavior generation and evaluation    | Agents are optional; focus is on internal ENI functions     |
| **Learning & Inference**      | Learning agents are first-class, tied to experience and evolution| Machine Learning is one component within Reasoning block    |
| **Policy Handling**           | Replaced by generative intent-based agents                     | Driven by policy input and external context                 |
| **Intent Model**              | Invented internally; not only interpreted                      | Consumed and processed within ENI modules                   |
| **Feedback Control**          | Continuous self-modeling via reflection and digital twin agents| Fixed loop: Evaluate → Learn → Update                        |
| **Lifecycle / Reconfiguration**| Runtime reconfiguration is autonomous and recursive            | Requires operator or external triggers                      |
| **Discovery & Composition**   | Agent discovery and runtime composition via intent             | Not explicitly addressed                                    |
| **Platform Awareness**        | System manages and evolves the substrate it depends on         | Infrastructure abstracted away                             |
| **Scope of Autonomy**         | Unbounded—can recursively adapt and restructure itself         | Bounded to inference-based adaptation                       |

These comparisons illustrate how the Autogenic Architecture diverges from current frameworks by:
- **Replacing external orchestration and policy layers** with internal goal interpretation and generation
- **Elevating runtime and platform control** to a reflective cognitive layer
- **Generalizing cognition across all system functions**, not restricting it to a reasoning module

This makes the autogenic model uniquely suited for systems that must operate with no external controller, plan their own behavior, and evolve autonomously over time.
