## Executive Summary

Autogenic systems represent a new class of intelligent architecture—capable not only of self-monitoring, self-configuration, and self-healing, but also of **goal invention, agent generation, and architectural self-evolution**. This research note introduces a modular framework for building such systems using agent-based components structured into seven distinct subsystems. Each subsystem maps to one or more Self-X capabilities, while adhering to a principle of minimal complexity: use the simplest agent required.

The architecture supports two key scopes of control: the system manages **its own infrastructure** and **the services it delivers**. Agents are typed by their cognitive capacity (Procedural, Learning, Recursive), and recursive agents are used sparingly—only where advanced reflection or restructuring is needed. The system is capable of operating without recursive agents in a degraded fallback mode, supporting progressive evolution over time.

This framework offers a path beyond autonomic and adaptive systems, defining concrete structures for **self-programming, structural introspection, and agent factories**. It unifies insights from TMF and ETSI standards with emerging work in cyber-physical systems, Industry 5.0, and self-evolving multi-agent architectures.

## 1. Introduction

Modern autonomous systems are reaching the limits of traditional automation and adaptation frameworks. While autonomic architectures provide robust self-management capabilities through mechanisms like MAPE-K loops, they typically operate within predefined boundaries. These systems can adapt to change, but they do not fundamentally reimagine themselves. They do not invent new goals, restructure their own logic, or generate new types of agents.

This research note introduces a model for **autogenic systems**—a class of intelligent architectures capable of recursive self-evolution. Autogenic systems are not merely adaptive; they are generative. They can create new internal structures, formulate novel goals, and manage their own growth over time. Their defining feature is the presence of **recursive agents**—agents that reason about the behavior and architecture of other agents, including themselves.

The proposed architecture is built from modular components, each represented by clusters of agents. It organizes functionality into seven core subsystems: execution, monitoring, analysis, planning, control, self-management, and peering. These subsystems correspond to distinct Self-X capabilities and cognitive functions, providing a clear path for design, verification, and extension.

To support both minimalism and evolution, agent complexity is stratified into three types: **Procedural**, **Learning**, and **Recursive**. Systems begin with a minimum viable set of procedural agents and evolve toward more complex reasoning behaviors only as needed. Recursive agents are introduced selectively, and fallback modes allow the system to degrade safely in their absence.

This note presents the principles, architecture, lifecycle, and cognitive mapping of autogenic systems, with references to relevant standards and adjacent research. It is intended as both a design guide and a conceptual foundation for future systems capable of managing not only services—but themselves.

## 2. Core Concepts

Autogenic systems are defined by their ability to evolve themselves over time. Unlike traditional autonomous systems, which operate within a fixed control structure, autogenic systems can modify their architecture, generate new agents, and invent new goals in response to changes in context, performance, or purpose.

### 2.1 What Is an Autogenic System?

An autogenic system is a self-managing system that includes:
- **Recursive reasoning** about its own behavior and structure
- **Agent generation and evolution** via internal factories
- **Self-hosting and self-governing capabilities**
- The ability to operate with degraded autonomy in fallback mode

These systems maintain both operational continuity and architectural plasticity, enabling long-term adaptation and self-renewal.

---

### 2.2 Agent Types

Agents are the atomic building blocks of autogenic systems. Every subsystem is implemented entirely with agents, and each agent belongs to one of three types:

| **Agent Type**  | **Capabilities**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Procedural**    | Executes fixed logic; does not learn or adapt                                  |
| **Learning**      | Tunes behavior based on feedback or observed patterns                          |
| **Recursive**     | Reflects on the system, generates logic or goals, manages agent composition    |

Recursive agents may include planners, critics, or agent factories. Learning agents typically operate in Analysis or Peering roles. Procedural agents are used wherever fixed behavior is sufficient.

---

### 2.3 Design Principles

1. **Minimal Viable Complexity**  
   Every subsystem is implemented using the **lowest agent type required**. Recursive agents are introduced only where reflection or restructuring is necessary.

2. **Self and Service Dual Scope**  
   The system manages both:
   - **Itself**: its own agents and architecture
   - **Its services**: the execution agents responsible for external outputs

3. **Fallback Readiness**  
   The system can degrade safely when recursive functionality is unavailable, using simpler agent logic and deferred evolution.

4. **Agent-Only Construction**  
   Every subsystem is composed of agents; there are no monolithic controllers or black-box engines. This allows modular reasoning, distributed operation, and recursive regeneration.

---

These core concepts provide the foundation for the autogenic architecture. In the next section, we explore how these agents and principles come together in a modular system design.

## 3. System Overview

Autogenic systems are organized into modular subsystems, each composed of agents specialized for a distinct cognitive role. Together, they form a service-oriented control plane capable of reasoning about itself and the services it delivers. The system operates within a dual-scope model:

- **Internal Scope**: Manages the system’s own agents and architecture
- **External Scope**: Manages one or more execution services delivered to external users or systems

### 3.2 Subsystem Roles

| **Subsystem**      | **Primary Function**                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Provides core services to external users                           |
| **Monitoring**      | Emits telemetry and health signals                                 |
| **Analysis**        | Evaluates behavior, detects anomalies, learns models               |
| **Planning**        | Invents goals, generates adaptation strategies                     |
| **Control**         | Applies changes, enforces policy, manages service lifecycle        |
| **Self-Management** | Evolves agents, restructures subsystems, hosts agent factories     |
| **Peering**         | Coordinates with external systems, aligns goals, negotiates scope  |

---

### 3.3 Platform Environment

The system runs on a distributed execution platform providing:
- **Service fabric** for agent hosting
- **Message bus** for agent communication
- **Persistent storage** for metadata and agent state
- **Observability hooks** for telemetry and logging
- **Intent-based interfaces** for goal submission and configuration

The platform itself may be managed partially or fully by the autogenic system, depending on deployment maturity.

---

### 3.4 Service Provision and Autonomy Patterns

Autogenic systems may deliver one or more services:
- **Centralized Control**: A single MAPE-K+ cluster governs all services
- **Distributed Autogenic Services**: Each service embeds its own autogenic control logic

In both cases, execution agents do not perform reasoning—they emit telemetry. Reasoning and structural adaptation are delegated to the MAPE subsystems and recursive agents.

---

This overview defines the system’s structure, roles, and runtime context. The next section specifies each subsystem and its functional logic in detail.

## 4. Subsystem Definitions

Each subsystem in the autogenic system fulfills a distinct cognitive and functional role. Subsystems are implemented entirely through agents, grouped by functionality. Each may contain a mix of procedural, learning, or recursive agents, depending on required complexity.

---

### 4.1 Execution Subsystem

**Function:** Deliver services to external users or systems.  
**Agent Type:** Procedural  
**Capabilities:**  
- Perform work as defined by intent
- Emit operational metrics and logs
- Do not self-optimize or adapt

Execution agents are externally visible and constitute the service output of the system.

---

### 4.2 Monitoring Subsystem

**Function:** Collect and report system telemetry.  
**Agent Type:** Procedural  
**Capabilities:**  
- Emit health status, metrics, logs, traces
- Feed observability metadata to Analysis agents
- Expose self-description to other agents

Monitoring is passive but essential for reflective subsystems to function.

---

### 4.3 Analysis Subsystem

**Function:** Understand system behavior through evaluation and learning.  
**Agent Type:** Learning  
**Capabilities:**  
- Detect anomalies, trends, and emergent behaviors
- Classify execution states and system configurations
- Update internal knowledge or models

Analysis agents support diagnosis, assessment, and inform both Planning and Self-Management.

---

### 4.4 Planning Subsystem

**Function:** Generate new goals and strategies.  
**Agent Type:** Recursive  
**Capabilities:**  
- Synthesize adaptation plans
- Invent goals or modify objectives
- Simulate effects of candidate changes

Planning may be centralized or distributed, depending on architecture.

---

### 4.5 Control Subsystem

**Function:** Enforce decisions and apply changes.  
**Agent Type:** Procedural (with optional Learning)  
**Capabilities:**  
- Execute plans created by Planning
- Enforce policies and constraints
- Orchestrate service reconfiguration

Control acts as the executor of system-wide changes and local interventions.

---

### 4.6 Self-Management Subsystem

**Function:** Govern the system’s own agents and structure.  
**Agent Type:** Recursive  
**Capabilities:**  
- Generate, evolve, and retire agents
- Reorganize subsystem clusters
- Maintain structural self-knowledge

Self-Management hosts agent factories and ensures architectural cohesion.

---

### 4.7 Peering Subsystem

**Function:** Interact with other systems or external peers.  
**Agent Type:** Recursive (with optional Learning)  
**Capabilities:**  
- Discover and negotiate with other systems
- Align and adapt shared goals
- Establish and manage coordination boundaries

Peering enables federated autonomy and inter-system reflection.

---

This layered decomposition ensures that each subsystem aligns with one or more Self-X capabilities while preserving architectural simplicity through agent specialization.

The next section examines how agents evolve over time—from procedural behavior to recursive intelligence.

## 5. Agent Lifecycle

Autogenic systems manage not only the services they deliver, but also the agents that compose themselves. Every agent in the system is subject to lifecycle management, which includes creation, operation, transformation, and eventual retirement. This lifecycle enables the system to adapt both in behavior and in structure over time.

---

### 5.1 Initialization and Bootstrapping

Autogenic systems begin with a **minimal viable set of procedural agents**. These agents implement the Execution, Monitoring, and Control subsystems, enabling basic service operation and observability.

At initialization:
- No recursive agents are present
- No learning takes place
- Fallback mode ensures safe, constrained operation

This configuration supports **autonomic self-management** but lacks evolution or introspection.

---

### 5.2 Agent Generation

As the system gains experience or encounters new intent, it may determine that new agents are required. These agents are generated by the **Self-Management subsystem**, which acts as an **agent factory**.

Generation may include:
- Instantiating a new procedural agent with defined service logic
- Producing a learning agent with tunable parameters
- Synthesizing a recursive agent for planning or structural reasoning

Recursive agents may themselves include the logic to generate other agents—enabling meta-adaptation.

---

### 5.3 Agent Evolution

Existing agents may evolve over time:
- **Procedural → Learning** through integration of feedback models
- **Learning → Recursive** by incorporating planning or structural introspection logic

Evolution is not always upward. In degraded environments, the system may replace recursive agents with simpler alternatives, reverting to fallback modes.

---

### 5.4 Agent Retirement

Agents are removed when:
- Their purpose is obsolete or replaced
- Their behavior is harmful or incorrect
- System restructuring requires reallocation of functionality

Retirement is controlled by the Self-Management subsystem, based on analysis signals and planning outputs.

---

### 5.5 Fallback and Recovery

If recursive agents fail, are compromised, or cannot be verified:
- The system reverts to procedural and learning agents
- Service continuity is preserved, but evolution halts
- Planning and Peering become passive or policy-constrained

Fallback behavior ensures resilience in hostile, resource-constrained, or undeveloped environments.

---

Agent lifecycles are fundamental to autogenic operation. They enable the system not only to act and adapt, but also to **redefine how it acts and adapts**. This foundation supports the Self-X capabilities explored in the next section.

## 6. Self-X Capability Mapping

Autogenic systems are defined by their ability to manage themselves across multiple dimensions of behavior. These are commonly known as **Self-X capabilities**, such as self-configuration, self-healing, or self-evolution. In autogenic architecture, each Self-X capability is implemented by one or more subsystems using the simplest agent types necessary.

---

### 6.1 Capability Implementation by Subsystem

| **Subsystem**      | **Implements Self-X Capabilities**                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Self-configuration, Self-preservation                                            |
| **Monitoring**      | Self-monitoring, Self-description                                                |
| **Analysis**        | Self-assessment, Self-learning, Self-knowledge                                   |
| **Planning**        | Self-programming, Self-orienting, Self-governance                                |
| **Control**         | Self-protection, Self-configuration, Self-healing                                |
| **Self-Management** | Self-reflection, Self-evolving, Self-hosting, Self-adaptation                    |
| **Peering**         | Self-organization, Self-orienting, Self-learning (external alignment and trust)  |

Each Self-X capability is tied to a cognitive function (e.g. reflection, decision, or execution), which the agent performs through interaction with telemetry, goals, policies, or structural models.

---

### 6.2 Role of Recursive Agents

Recursive agents are required for:
- **Self-reflection**: Introspective reasoning about the architecture or agents
- **Self-programming**: Generating new logic or plans from abstract goals
- **Self-evolving**: Creating or restructuring agent networks and control flows
- **Self-orienting**: Inventing or redefining goals based on changing priorities

Where these capabilities are not needed, simpler agent types are used. This maintains architectural simplicity while supporting full system evolution when required.

---

### 6.3 Capability Distribution Summary

| **Self-X Capability**     | **Minimum Agent Type** | **Primary Subsystem(s)**                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Self-monitoring           | Procedural             | Monitoring                                   |
| Self-assessment           | Learning               | Analysis                                     |
| Self-programming          | Recursive              | Planning                                     |
| Self-configuration        | Procedural             | Execution, Control                           |
| Self-healing              | Procedural             | Control                                      |
| Self-learning             | Learning               | Analysis, Peering                            |
| Self-reflection           | Recursive              | Self-Management                              |
| Self-evolving             | Recursive              | Self-Management                              |
| Self-governance           | Recursive              | Planning, Control                            |
| Self-orienting            | Recursive              | Planning, Peering                            |
| Self-organization         | Recursive              | Peering                                      |
| Self-description          | Procedural             | Monitoring                                   |

---

This mapping ensures that every cognitive behavior expected of the system is grounded in agent-level logic and subsystem roles. The next section explains how these capabilities are maintained under degradation or in fallback mode.

## 7. Fallback Modes and Degradation Strategy

Recursive agents enable powerful forms of reasoning, evolution, and goal invention. However, they are also complex, costly, and potentially fragile. Autogenic systems are designed with the principle of graceful degradation: when recursive agents fail or are unavailable, the system falls back to a simpler operational mode that preserves service continuity.

---

### 7.1 Motivation for Fallback

Fallback modes are necessary in situations such as:
- Resource exhaustion (e.g., no compute budget for recursive planning)
- Security concerns (e.g., recursive agent compromise)
- Early deployment or bootstrapping phases
- Operating in environments with degraded connectivity or external dependencies

Rather than fail, the system **switches to a lower reflection mode**, relying solely on procedural and learning agents.

---

### 7.2 Subsystem Behavior Without Recursive Agents

| **Subsystem**      | **Degraded Behavior (Fallback Mode)**                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Continues service operation                                                       |
| **Monitoring**      | Continues emitting telemetry                                                      |
| **Analysis**        | Performs pattern detection but not structural diagnosis                           |
| **Planning**        | Reverts to fixed playbooks or goal templates                                      |
| **Control**         | Applies pre-approved actions; cannot generate novel strategies                    |
| **Self-Management** | Suspended; no agent generation or architectural reorganization                    |
| **Peering**         | Operates on static coordination rules; no negotiation or dynamic alignment        |

Recursive behaviors like goal invention, logic synthesis, and structural introspection are disabled. The system maintains a **stable operating baseline** but cannot improve itself.

---

### 7.3 Design Implication

Fallback is not failure—it is **autonomy within limits**. It ensures:
- Robustness in constrained environments
- Predictability during system rollout or restart
- A foundation for progressive reintroduction of recursive reasoning

---

### 7.4 Reintegration of Recursive Agents

When conditions permit, the system may:
- Reactivate existing recursive agents
- Generate new ones through Self-Management
- Resume planning and structural adaptation
- Rebuild introspective models

This enables a **progressive return to full autogenic operation** without disrupting core services.

---

Fallback modes allow autogenic systems to bridge the gap between fixed-function automation and recursive intelligence. They enforce the principle of minimal complexity, enabling safe evolution at runtime.

In the next section, we place this work in context by comparing it to relevant standards and emerging research.

## 8. Related Work

Autogenic systems draw inspiration from multiple lines of research and practice—including autonomic computing, agent-based modeling, digital twins, and cognitive systems. However, no existing framework combines recursive agent architectures, agent factories, and fallback-capable introspection into a single system. This section reviews the most relevant foundations and contrasts them with the proposed design.

---

### 8.1 Standards-Based Architectures

#### TM Forum IG1251 / IG1252
- Defines service-oriented control architecture with roles such as Intent Handler and Service Orchestration Controller.
- Introduces the concept of increasing autonomy levels (L0–L5), with self-evolution emerging at Level 5.
- Agent logic and goal structure are assumed static; agent generation is not modeled.

#### ETSI ENI 051
- Proposes an AI-driven network management architecture based on closed-loop adaptation and cognitive learning.
- Introduces Meta-Knowledge Management and Knowledge Evolution functions.
- Emphasizes learning and inference, but lacks recursive agent models or agent lifecycle orchestration.

**Limitation (Both):** Neither framework supports agent factories, recursive agent evolution, or agent-invented goal architectures.

---

### 8.2 Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 5.0

- CPS and IIoT systems emphasize distributed control and adaptive sensing.  
  *Liu et al.* describe smart agents in industrial CPS environments, supporting modularity and diagnosis.
- Industry 5.0 introduces human-centric autonomy, enhanced digital twins, and coordination between physical and virtual systems.
  *Jung et al.* and *Fan et al.* highlight factory systems with intelligent agents and XR-enabled service evolution.

**Limitation:** These systems emphasize resilience and monitoring, but agents do not generate new goals or structures.

---

### 8.3 Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems

- *Agentic Neural Networks* (Chien et al.) demonstrate LLM-driven agent teams that evolve through recursive reflection and feedback.
- *EvoMAC* (Murugesan et al.) introduces adaptive collaboration among multi-agent teams using meta-agent critiques.

**Similarity:** These architectures feature recursive feedback and dynamic role reallocation.
**Gap:** They do not model full-service control systems, agent lifecycle factories, or fallback resilience mechanisms.

---

### 8.4 Autonomic and Decentralized Systems

- IBM’s autonomic computing blueprint introduced MAPE-K loops, supporting self-configuration, self-healing, and optimization.
- Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS) offer peer-based coordination across modular agents.

**Limitation:** These frameworks assume static agent roles and rely on human-defined reconfiguration boundaries.

---

### 8.5 Summary of Contributions

| **Capability**                     | **In Prior Art?** | **In Autogenic System**                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Recursive agents                   |  No               |  Defined and operationalized            |
| Agent factories                    |  No               |  Hosted in Self-Management              |
| Goal invention                     |  Hinted           |  Planning subsystem with recursive logic|
| Structural self-evolution          |  No               |  Via agent lifecycle and fallback logic |
| Fallback-based degradation control |  No               |  Formalized via subsystem behavior      |

---

Autogenic systems build on the strengths of past architectures while addressing their key limitations. By introducing recursive control, internal structural evolution, and dual-scope reasoning, they offer a new model for long-term autonomy.

## 9. Future Work

The architecture proposed in this research note introduces foundational elements for autogenic systems, but several research and engineering challenges remain. These span verification, safety, scaling, and coordination across distributed environments.

---

### 9.1 Verification and Safety of Recursive Agents

Recursive agents are powerful but complex. Ensuring that they generate safe, coherent, and bounded behaviors is essential.

Open problems include:
- Formal verification of generated logic
- Containment of self-modifying agents
- Runtime guarantees for agent factories
- Preventing recursive feedback loops that degrade system stability

This requires new techniques in program synthesis validation, safety envelopes, and meta-agent introspection.

---

### 9.2 Learning to Self-Program Safely

While current systems can adapt policies or parameters, few can generate new execution logic or internal control flows.

Future research must explore:
- The transition from learned behavior to generated code
- Using LLMs and other generative models for safe recursive planning
- Replay and simulation environments for validating new behavior before deployment

This may involve integrating digital twin environments with reflective planning and agent supervision.

---

### 9.3 Federated Goal Alignment

In distributed deployments, autogenic systems may interact, negotiate, or conflict. These interactions raise coordination and ethics challenges:

- How should recursive agents align or prioritize goals across systems?
- Can peering agents negotiate shared objectives?
- What governance is needed when multiple autogenic systems interact?

This is particularly relevant in domains such as Industry 5.0, edge AI, and autonomous service networks.

---

### 9.4 Deployment and Evolution at Scale

Operationalizing autogenic systems requires:
- Lightweight procedural agent bootstraps
- Declarative agent templates and metadata formats
- Platform interfaces for introspective and external control
- Mechanisms for fallback detection and recovery

Autogenic systems must be composable, introspectable, and resilient across a range of runtime environments, including embedded, cloud-native, and edge platforms.

---

### 9.5 Toward Autogenic Ecosystems

Eventually, autogenic systems may coordinate at the ecosystem level—forming dynamic coalitions, exchanging agents, or contributing to federated service goals.

This implies:
- Cross-system agent mobility
- Shared reflection models
- Distributed agent trust and reputation systems
- Collective self-evolution logic

The long-term vision is a **web of recursive systems** that reason about themselves, their peers, and the ecosystems they inhabit.

---

These directions chart a path for advancing autogenic architecture into deployable, collaborative, and self-improving infrastructures. The following appendices provide technical detail, mappings, and references to support further exploration.

## Appendix A: Fallback Mode Matrix

Autogenic systems are designed to operate in both full and degraded modes. When recursive agents are unavailable—due to failure, policy, or immaturity—the system falls back to simpler agent behavior. This appendix summarizes the impact of fallback mode on each subsystem.

---

### A.1 Subsystem Degradation Table

| **Subsystem**      | **Full Mode (Recursive Agents Enabled)**                                | **Fallback Mode (Recursive Agents Absent)**                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Emits metrics, participates in planning cycles                          | Emits metrics only; no behavioral adaptation                             |
| **Monitoring**      | Supplies observability metadata and self-description                    | Same behavior (procedural; not affected)                                 |
| **Analysis**        | Learns behavioral patterns and contributes to model evolution           | Performs statistical evaluation only; no knowledge inference             |
| **Planning**        | Generates goals, strategies, and novel behaviors                        | Uses predefined templates or static rules; no goal invention             |
| **Control**         | Executes dynamic plans; adapts policies and triggers autonomously       | Executes predefined control rules; does not adapt strategy               |
| **Self-Management** | Evolves agents, generates factories, restructures subsystems            | Frozen; no agent generation or structural adaptation                     |
| **Peering**         | Negotiates intent, shares goals, and adapts to external systems         | Uses static coordination rules; cannot align dynamically                 |

---

### A.2 Design Implications

Fallback mode preserves:
- **Service continuity**
- **Telemetry**
- **Basic diagnostics and control**

But disables:
- **Goal invention**
- **Agent evolution**
- **Structural introspection**
- **Dynamic peer alignment**

This distinction ensures robustness while enabling progressive adoption of recursive capabilities over time.

---

### A.3 Transition and Reintegration

Fallback is not a terminal state. The system may return to full mode by:
- Regenerating recursive agents from metadata
- Reactivating pre-trained recursive modules
- Reconfiguring trust or policy constraints

In this way, fallback supports not just resilience—but eventual evolution.

## Appendix B: Standards Comparison (TMF IG1251, ETSI ENI 051)

This appendix compares the autogenic system architecture to two leading standards frameworks: TM Forum IG1251 (Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture) and ETSI ENI 051 (Cognitive Network Management). The comparison highlights areas of alignment, divergence, and novel contributions.

---

### B.1 Comparison with TMF IG1251

**Overview:** TMF IG1251 defines a layered reference architecture for autonomous networks, structured around functional blocks such as Intent Management, Orchestration, Policy, and AI Operations.

| **Dimension**                 | **TMF IG1251**                                      | **Autogenic System**                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Control Loop Design**       | MAPE-K variants with defined roles                  | Agent-based MAPE-K clusters mapped to subsystems           |
| **Agent Model**               | Implicit; functions performed by service components | Explicit agent architecture with types and lifecycles      |
| **Agent Generation**          | Not addressed                                       | Explicit in Self-Management subsystem                      |
| **Goal Handling**             | Intent Manager decomposes structured goals          | Recursive agents invent, decompose, and evolve goals       |
| **Fallback Mechanisms**       | Not specified                                       | Formalized across all subsystems                           |
| **Digital Twin / Sandbox**    | Optional simulation environment                     | Digital twin realized via embedded agents                  |
| **Autonomy Levels**           | Defined (L0–L5) with focus on capabilities          | Used to guide fallback strategy and agent complexity        |

**Summary:** TMF IG1251 aligns at the functional level but lacks recursive agent modeling, agent factories, or structural evolution.

---

### B.2 Comparison with ETSI ENI 051

**Overview:** ENI 051 presents a closed-loop cognitive architecture for network management with functional blocks such as Context Building, Inference, Policy Management, and Knowledge Evolution.

| **Dimension**                 | **ETSI ENI 051**                                    | **Autogenic System**                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learning and Inference**    | Central to adaptation loops                         | Distributed across Analysis and Planning subsystems         |
| **Knowledge Evolution**       | Managed via MKM (Meta-Knowledge Management)         | Performed by recursive agents and self-management          |
| **Agent Lifecycle**           | Not modeled                                         | Explicit lifecycle with generation, evolution, retirement  |
| **Agent Types**               | Not defined                                         | Procedural, Learning, Recursive                            |
| **Planning Behavior**         | Policy-based inference                              | Goal invention and code synthesis by recursive agents      |
| **Peering**                   | Not specified                                       | Embedded via recursive peering agents                     |

**Summary:** ENI 051 introduces important cognitive mechanisms, but the autogenic architecture extends these with agent specialization, meta-reasoning, and adaptive system structure.

---

### B.3 Novel Contributions

| **Capability**                      | **TMF** | **ETSI** | **Autogenic System** |
|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|----------------------|

| Metadata-driven regeneration        | No     | Maybe   | Yes                    |


---

This comparison reinforces the novelty of the autogenic system architecture, especially in its integration of agent-level introspection, system-wide recursion, and structured fallback design.

## Appendix C: Agent Types and Functionalities

Autogenic systems are built entirely from agents. Each agent is typed by its cognitive and behavioral complexity, and every subsystem is implemented using the **simplest agent type required** to fulfill its role. This appendix defines the three agent types and their expected functionalities.

---

### C.1 Agent Type Classification

| **Agent Type**   | **Core Capabilities**                                                | **Subsystem Presence**                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Procedural**    | Executes fixed logic; no learning or adaptation                      | Execution, Monitoring, Control                                |
| **Learning**      | Adjusts behavior via training, feedback, or pattern recognition      | Analysis, Peering (optional), Control (optional)              |
| **Recursive**     | Performs introspection, invents goals, generates agents or logic     | Planning, Self-Management, Peering (optional)                 |

Agents may be upgraded over time (e.g., procedural → learning) via internal evolution.

---

### C.2 Agent Roles by Subsystem

| **Subsystem**      | **Expected Agent Types**              | **Functionality per Agent Type**                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Procedural                            | Perform actions, emit status, execute intent without change                                       |
| **Monitoring**      | Procedural                            | Collect logs, emit telemetry, expose metrics                                                      |
| **Analysis**        | Learning                              | Detect anomalies, assess trends, infer behavioral models                                          |
| **Planning**        | Recursive                             | Invent goals, simulate outcomes, generate or mutate behavior plans                                |
| **Control**         | Procedural (some Learning)            | Apply actions, enforce policy, resolve runtime state                                              |
| **Self-Management** | Recursive                             | Manage agent lifecycle, restructure subsystems, govern evolution                                  |
| **Peering**         | Recursive (optional Learning)         | Align with external goals, negotiate scope, establish shared protocols                            |

---

### C.3 Composite Agent Design

While procedural agents are atomic, **learning and recursive agents may be composite**, containing or coordinating other agents:

- **Learning agents** may wrap procedural components and adapt their parameters.
- **Recursive agents** often consist of a **producer–critic pair**, where:
  - **Producer** generates a candidate action, goal, or agent.
  - **Critic** evaluates the output for alignment, coherence, or safety.

This structure supports bounded self-improvement and introspective regulation.

---

### C.4 Deployment Considerations

Agent complexity affects deployment:

| **Agent Type**   | **Resource Footprint** | **Required Platform Features**                      |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Procedural        | Low                   | Basic runtime and messaging                         |
| Learning          | Medium                | Model execution, training feedback, data storage    |
| Recursive         | High                  | Simulation, planning sandbox, metadata processing   |

Subsystem fallback strategies are triggered when higher-complexity agents become unavailable or are intentionally disabled.

---

By understanding agent roles and required capabilities, system designers can balance functionality, resource usage, and evolutionary potential—ensuring stable operation today and recursive autonomy tomorrow.

## Appendix D: Metadata Mapping by Subsystem

Autogenic systems rely on structured metadata to drive decision-making, planning, and control. Metadata is not executable—it encodes goals, structure, status, and intent. This appendix maps the relevant metadata types to each subsystem and clarifies their roles.

---

### D.1 Metadata Types and Functions

| **Metadata Type**          | **Purpose**                                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intent Metadata**         | Describes service goals, user expectations, and system objectives       |
| **Observability Metadata**  | Defines metrics, thresholds, logging behavior, and telemetry probes     |
| **Behavioral Metadata**     | Inferred models of system dynamics, anomalies, or usage trends          |
| **Structural Metadata**     | Captures topology, agent relationships, and subsystem composition       |
| **Policy Metadata**         | Encodes constraints, conditions, and permitted actions                  |
| **Knowledge Metadata**      | Summarizes experience, learned models, and inferred operational logic   |
| **Platform Metadata**       | Describes resource constraints, nodes, execution environment            |

---

### D.2 Subsystem Metadata Roles

| **Subsystem**      | **Consumes**                             | **Produces**                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Intent, Platform                         | Runtime State (for Monitoring)             |
| **Monitoring**      | Observability                            | Runtime Data, Observability Metadata       |
| **Analysis**        | Runtime Data, Observability              | Behavioral, Knowledge                      |
| **Planning**        | Behavioral, Knowledge, Intent            | Adaptation Plans, Goal Metadata            |
| **Control**         | Plans, Policy, Platform                  | Updated Configs, Execution Triggers        |
| **Self-Management** | Structural, Knowledge, Policy            | Generated Metadata, Agent Blueprints       |
| **Peering**         | Intent, Policy, Knowledge (external)     | Alignment Reports, Shared Intent           |

---

### D.3 Metadata Lifecycle Integration

- **Design Phase**: Intent, Policy, and Structural metadata are defined.
- **Operation Phase**: Observability and Behavioral metadata are generated and updated.
- **Adaptation Phase**: Planning and Self-Management use metadata to evolve the system.
- **Retirement Phase**: Metadata is archived, reused, or purged.

Recursive agents often **consume and mutate metadata**, transforming declarative goals into generative logic or executable blueprints.

---

### D.4 Role of Metadata in Fallback Modes

- Metadata remains available even if recursive agents are inactive.
- Plans or templates based on existing metadata can be reused.
- Metadata-driven logic enables static execution, monitoring, and minimal adaptation.

---

---

This glossary provides a reference to support understanding across sections, ensuring consistent interpretation of autogenic system concepts.

## Appendix F: Self-X Capability to Subsystem Mapping

This appendix provides a consolidated mapping of self-* capabilities to the subsystems that implement them. Each capability is grounded in agent behavior and reflects the system’s ability to adapt, protect, or evolve itself over time.

---

### F.1 Self-X Capability Implementation Matrix

| **Self-X Capability**     | **Primary Subsystem(s)**         | **Supporting Agent Type(s)**          |

---

### F.2 Highlights

- **Procedural subsystems** (Execution, Monitoring, Control) enable baseline autonomy: configuration, healing, and telemetry.
- **Learning subsystems** (Analysis, Peering) provide adaptive reasoning and classification.
- **Recursive subsystems** (Planning, Self-Management, Peering) enable higher-order behaviors: structural evolution, goal invention, and policy alignment.

---

### F.3 Design Alignment

Each subsystem implements one or more Self-X capabilities based on:
- Its cognitive role in the MAPE-K feedback loop
- The complexity of agents required
- Whether introspective or generative behavior is needed

This mapping ensures that all cognitive behaviors are distributed across modular components, allowing both composability and evolution.

---

In the next appendix, we define the execution environment requirements that support these behaviors and agent types.

## Appendix G: Execution Environment Requirements

Autogenic systems require a runtime environment that supports modular agent execution, intent-driven interaction, and introspective evolution. This appendix defines the foundational platform services, constraints, and interfaces that enable the system to function effectively.

---

### G.1 Core Platform Capabilities

| **Capability**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent Hosting**             | Runtime environment to instantiate, isolate, and manage agents                  |
| **Service Fabric**            | Supports service delivery, scalability, and high availability                   |
| **Message Bus**               | Asynchronous communication among agents and with external interfaces           |
| **Observability Hooks**       | Metrics, tracing, and logging interfaces for monitoring and feedback loops      |
| **Intent Interface**          | External interface for submitting structured goals or reconfiguration intents  |
| **Storage and State**         | Persistent storage for agent metadata, plans, models, and generated artifacts   |
| **Policy Enforcement Layer**  | Runtime guards for policy, safety, and bounded execution                        |
| **Simulation Sandbox**        | Digital twin environment for planning, testing, and goal simulation             |

---

### G.2 Platform Modes

| **Mode**             | **Purpose**                                              | **Used By**                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Operational Mode** | Hosts live agents and delivers services                   | Execution, Control, Peering         |
| **Reflective Mode**  | Enables simulation, planning, and agent generation        | Planning, Self-Management           |
| **Fallback Mode**    | Disables high-complexity agents, preserving core services | All subsystems (fallback compatible)|

The environment must support dynamic transitions between these modes without full system restart.

---

### G.3 Platform Interface Requirements

- **Declarative API** for goal submission and status queries
- **Metadata registry** for introspection, traceability, and provenance
- **Security sandboxing** for recursive agents and generated logic
- **Trust and authentication** between peering systems or federated agents

---

### G.4 Minimal Viable Environment

To bootstrap, the system only requires:
- Agent runtime engine for procedural agents
- Telemetry collector and storage
- Intent parser and dispatcher
- Basic policy enforcement

All other features can be added incrementally, allowing deployment in constrained environments (e.g., embedded, edge).

---

This execution environment acts as the substrate over which the autogenic system operates—supporting both core services and its own introspective evolution.

## Appendix H: Subsystems as Self-X Implementations

Each subsystem in an autogenic system is not just a functional block—it is a concrete implementation of one or more self-X capabilities. This appendix outlines how these subsystems embody those capabilities in practice.

---

### H.1 Execution Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-configuration** through intent-based execution bindings
- **Self-preservation** by maintaining service integrity under stress

**How:**  
Execution agents carry out specified behaviors defined by intent metadata. They are aware of local health and may trigger protective mechanisms or alerts via Monitoring and Control.

---

### H.2 Monitoring Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-monitoring** by emitting real-time telemetry
- **Self-description** by exposing metadata about execution state and system structure

**How:**  
Agents collect and report data continuously. They follow declarative observability metadata and expose service and agent state to the rest of the system.

---

### H.3 Analysis Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-assessment** by evaluating metrics and logs
- **Self-learning** through feedback and pattern recognition
- **Self-knowledge** by building internal behavioral models

**How:**  
Learning agents observe system outputs, detect anomalies, classify behaviors, and update models used by planning or control.

---

### H.4 Planning Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-programming** by generating executable logic or behavior plans
- **Self-governance** by shaping internal goals and priorities
- **Self-orienting** through reflective goal invention

**How:**  
Recursive agents in this subsystem create new plans or adjust strategic objectives. They simulate consequences and adapt intent based on learned knowledge or external alignment.

---

### H.5 Control Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-healing** by initiating recovery or rollback actions
- **Self-configuration** by enforcing policy-compliant states
- **Self-protection** through boundary conditions and runtime enforcement

**How:**  
Control agents act on inputs from Planning and Analysis to enact state changes. They ensure that execution agents conform to desired behavior.

---

### H.6 Self-Management Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-reflection** via structural introspection and analysis
- **Self-evolving** through agent lifecycle orchestration
- **Self-hosting** by maintaining internal agent platform integrity

**How:**  
Recursive agents here manage agent generation, retirement, and subsystem topology. They are the primary mechanism for structural self-modification.

---

### H.7 Peering Subsystem

**Implements:**
- **Self-orienting** by aligning internal goals with external systems
- **Self-organization** through coordination and federation
- **Self-learning** in trust, intent negotiation, and shared model inference

**How:**  
Recursive or learning agents engage with peers to align behavior, resolve conflicts, and exchange goals. They support federated autonomy in multi-system ecosystems.

---

Together, these subsystems form a distributed cognitive architecture where each self-X capability is grounded in concrete behaviors and agent responsibilities.

## Appendix I: Dual-Scope System Control Patterns

Autogenic systems manage two distinct yet interdependent domains: their own internal structure and the services they provide. This appendix defines the dual-scope control model and outlines common patterns for managing both scopes concurrently.

---

### I.1 Scope Definitions

| **Scope**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal Scope**   | Refers to the autogenic system managing its own agents, subsystems, and architecture |
| **External Scope**   | Refers to the services the system provides to users, consumers, or other systems    |

---

### I.2 Control Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Centralized MAPE-K Control (External Scope Only)
- One global MAPE-K cluster manages all services.
- Services (execution agents) are passive, emitting telemetry.
- No local planning or control embedded within service components.

**Use Case:** Initial deployments, tightly governed systems, low service autonomy.

---

#### Pattern 2: Distributed Autogenic Services (Dual Autogenic Scope)
- Each service embeds its own MAPE-K loop or agent cluster.
- The autogenic system acts as a host, trust anchor, and coordinator.
- Enables autonomy at the edge while maintaining oversight.

**Use Case:** Scalable, multi-service ecosystems with federated decision-making.

---

#### Pattern 3: Recursive Peering Across Systems
- Internal self-management generates or aligns recursive peering agents.
- External goals may be co-invented or negotiated with peers.
- Allows federated autonomy and service coalitions.

**Use Case:** Industry 5.0, cross-domain systems, or sovereign service collaboration.

---

### I.3 Service Execution Architecture

| **Component**            | **Role**                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution agents**      | Perform actual work as defined by service goals         |
| **Control subsystem**     | Enforces service logic, policy, and fault recovery      |
| **Monitoring subsystem**  | Emits real-time telemetry from execution environments   |
| **Planning subsystem**    | Generates or modifies service-level goals               |

All of these components may be duplicated per service or shared globally, depending on scope strategy.

---

### I.4 System-Within-a-System Management

The autogenic system applies the same architectural pattern recursively:
- Its own structure is governed by a MAPE-K loop with introspective agents.
- Generated agents for services are treated as resources under management.
- Agent factories span both internal control and external service expansion.

This recursive structure supports both **self-improvement** and **self-replication**, without external intervention.

---

Dual-scope control is a foundational design pattern in autogenic systems. It ensures that the architecture is both self-sustaining and outward-facing—capable of managing its own growth while delivering autonomous services.
