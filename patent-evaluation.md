## 1. Introduction

Most patent strategies are built around two traditional objectives: **defensive protection of core products** and **offensive positioning in standards or competitive chokepoints**. These are necessary pillars of IP operations‚Äîbut not sufficient. As innovation cycles accelerate and convergence blurs domain boundaries, there is growing value in pursuing a **third category of strategic patents**: those that claim underdeveloped, under-patented, or future-relevant territories.

We define this third bucket as the **White Space & Foresight Patent Strategy**. It seeks to secure intellectual property in areas not yet crowded by competitors, not yet commercialized, but **technically plausible, strategically aligned, and clusterable** over time. This research note outlines a rigorous evaluation framework for selecting which invention disclosures should be advanced under this category.

## 2. Strategic Purpose of the White Space Bucket

This patent bucket is designed to:
- **Stake claims in emerging domains** before they become valuable
- **Occupy IP ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù** to control future innovation lanes
- **Enable clusterable IP** families that evolve with technology
- **Support standardization and ecosystem shaping**
- **Demonstrate leadership in foresight-driven innovation**

Unlike product-aligned filings, these patents are not judged by short-term commercial payoff but by their **strategic optionality** and **portfolio expansion potential**.

## 3. Design Principles for Evaluation

To avoid speculative or low-impact filings, we define ten evaluation dimensions. Each balances:
- **Technical novelty** with **landscape opportunity**
- **Foresight plausibility** with **claimable breadth**
- **Market shaping potential** with **cluster development strategy**

These dimensions are weighted to prioritize **strategic novelty**, **territory control**, and **future expandability**.

## 4. Evaluation Framework

| # | Dimension | Description | Weight |
|--:|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Strategic Novelty | How distinct is this invention in the current IP landscape? | 2.0√ó |
| 2 | Claimable Territory | Can this serve as the seed for a multi-claim, multi-filing cluster? | 2.0√ó |
| 3 | Foresight Alignment | Does this align with 5‚Äì10 year technology forecasts or convergence paths? | 1.5√ó |
| 4 | Market Potential | Could this apply to future high-value domains? | 1.5√ó |
| 5 | White Space Clarity | Is the surrounding IP space unclaimed or weakly defended? | 1.5√ó |
| 6 | Cross-Domain Utility | Does the invention span industries or use cases? | 1.0√ó |
| 7 | Ecosystem / Standardization Potential | Could it shape or become part of a future technical standard or platform? | 1.5√ó |
| 8 | Technical Plausibility | Is the invention reasonably buildable within 5‚Äì10 years? | 1.0√ó |
| 9 | Follow-on Filing Potential | Are multiple continuation or domain-specific claims foreseeable? | 1.5√ó |
|10| Signal Value | Would filing this demonstrate innovation leadership? | 1.0√ó |

A cumulative weighted score is used to recommend whether to:
- **File a full utility patent** (41‚Äì50)
- **File a provisional and monitor** (30‚Äì40)
- **Reassess with more input** (20‚Äì29)
- **Decline or convert to publication** (<20)

## 5. Integration into Portfolio Strategy

This evaluation framework complements existing IP strategies:

| Bucket | Focus | Evaluation Criteria |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| üõ°Ô∏è Defensive | Product and platform protection | Product linkage, FTO, technical coverage |
| üó°Ô∏è Offensive | Standards and competitor blocking | Standard participation, market control |
| üöÄ White Space | Future markets and emerging tech | Novelty, foresight, clusterability, platform leverage |

The white space track operates like a **venture portfolio**‚Äîfew filings may succeed, but those that do can define long-term IP positioning.

---

## 6. Governance and Process

To operationalize this framework:
- A dedicated **review track** is created within the patent committee
- A lightweight **disclosure template** is customized for foresight IP
- Quarterly **white space scans** support discovery
- Evaluation records are logged in a searchable system (e.g., Notion, Airtable)

Optional additions include AI-assisted prior art scans, CPC density heatmaps, and cross-mapping to internal research roadmaps.

---

## 7. Conclusion

White space and foresight patents are not speculative indulgences. When evaluated rigorously and selected deliberately, they serve as **strategic IP beachheads**‚Äîoffering long-term leverage, licensing potential, and innovation narrative control. This framework enables disciplined exploration of those frontier opportunities and integrates them into a balanced, three-pronged patent portfolio strategy.
