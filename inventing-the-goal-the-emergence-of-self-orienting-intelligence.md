# Inventing the Goal: The Emergence of Self-Orienting Intelligence  
*by C.G. Djinovic*
*June 25, 2025*

## Executive Summary

As intelligent systems progress beyond automation and adaptation, the ability to formulate goals autonomously—without external specification—emerges as a defining capability. This research note examines the architectural, computational, and conceptual foundations of **self-orienting systems**: systems that do not merely pursue predefined objectives, but invent new ones in response to internal signals, contextual novelty, or long-term strategic uncertainty.

Unlike adaptive agents that optimize within a bounded set of options, self-orienting systems redefine the space of objectives itself. They represent a step change in autonomy—one that requires rethinking how intent, competence, and feedback are encoded and managed in artificial systems.

Drawing from developmental robotics, reinforcement learning, self-play architectures, and language model–guided agents, this note surveys real-world examples where goal invention is implemented, scales, and yields emergent curricula of increasing complexity. It highlights the techniques these systems use—learning progress tracking, intrinsic motivation, semantic goal construction—and identifies the architectural principles that enable them to operate without human-specified purpose.

The findings argue that self-orienting is not speculative. It is already here, unevenly distributed. What remains is to recognize its architectural signature, understand its scaling behavior, and formalize its role in autogenic systems—those capable of inventing, programming, and evolving their own goals and behaviors.

## 1. Introduction

Modern AI systems operate in environments that are increasingly open-ended, multi-modal, and dynamically structured. In such contexts, success is no longer defined solely by the ability to optimize a pre-specified objective. Instead, it often hinges on an agent’s capacity to recognize when its current goals are inadequate—and to invent new ones.

Most existing architectures, even those labeled autonomous or self-adaptive, rely on goals that are either explicitly defined by designers or implied through reward functions. These goals may be adjusted, decomposed, or reprioritized, but they are rarely generated from scratch by the system itself. This constraint places a fundamental limit on what such systems can achieve: they can adapt, but they cannot reorient.

This research note argues that **self-orienting**—the ability of a system to formulate new goals without external specification—is an essential, measurable, and increasingly realizable capability. It differentiates reactive and adaptive intelligence from a more generative, autogenic form of intelligence: one in which the agent decides not only *how* to act, but *what* to want.

We ground this claim in practice, not philosophy. Across developmental robotics, reinforcement learning, and emerging agent architectures, we find systems that already exhibit self-orienting behavior. They generate parameterized goals based on learning progress, use adversarial self-play to bootstrap skill complexity, or leverage language models to create structured task hierarchies. These systems don’t just react to the world—they author their engagement with it.

This note provides a conceptual framework, technical taxonomy, and empirical survey of such systems. It aims to characterize how self-orienting intelligence arises, what architectures support it, and how it may be extended to support truly autogenic systems—systems that do not merely adapt to change, but change what they are adapting to.

## 2. Conceptual Foundations

### 2.1 What Is Self-Orienting?

Self-orienting is the capacity of a system to formulate novel goals without external specification. It is the ability to **invent what to pursue**, rather than merely optimizing how to pursue something predefined. In this sense, it is distinct from goal selection, prioritization, or refinement. A self-orienting system identifies the absence, irrelevance, or exhaustion of existing objectives and acts to generate new ones.

This capability requires internal mechanisms for:
- **Recognizing misalignment or stagnation**, such as declining learning progress or persistent failure.
- **Representing and reasoning about alternative objectives**, either symbolically or through embeddings.
- **Generating candidate goals** and assessing their feasibility, novelty, or utility relative to current capabilities.

Self-orienting is most easily observed when systems operate in **open task spaces**—contexts where the boundaries of acceptable behavior are not well-defined, and where adaptability alone is insufficient. In such environments, fixed goals decay in relevance. A self-orienting agent remains viable by inventing new goals that reflect shifts in context, opportunity, or internal state.

At its core, self-orienting intelligence is reflective. It is not merely reactive to environmental change; it is sensitive to **the adequacy of its own orientation** within that environment. This makes it a higher-order capability—meta-intentional, in the sense that the system monitors not only how well it is acting, but whether it is pursuing the right thing at all.

Self-orienting is a prerequisite for full autogenic capability. Without it, a system may configure and optimize itself, but it cannot evolve its purpose.

### 2.2 Goal Invention vs Goal Selection

Goal selection and goal invention are frequently conflated in discussions of autonomy. The distinction is not cosmetic—it is architectural. Most adaptive systems today engage in **goal selection**: choosing among a set of predefined objectives based on context, priority, or feasibility. These goals may be hierarchically structured, probabilistically weighted, or dynamically reordered, but they are externally authored. The agent does not question the menu; it simply selects from it.

In contrast, **goal invention** begins where selection ends. It requires that the system operate without a complete set of predefined objectives. Instead, the agent must:
- Detect that no existing goal is sufficient or relevant,
- Propose new objectives based on internal state, competence, or contextual novelty,
- Represent and evaluate these goals using available semantic, behavioral, or predictive models.

Goal selection assumes a closed-world ontology. Goal invention assumes an open world.

This distinction mirrors the difference between **navigating** and **charting**. A system that selects among goals is like a ship navigating a map. A self-orienting system invents the map.

Some systems blur this boundary. BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agents, for instance, may appear to generate goals, but in practice they instantiate “desires” from a predefined set. Similarly, reinforcement learning agents trained with curriculum learning may progress through increasingly difficult tasks, but the tasks themselves are still externally structured.

True goal invention is rare because it requires that a system:
- Recognize when existing tasks are exhausted,
- Encode novelty or dissatisfaction as a trigger,
- Formulate and pursue previously unconsidered goals.

In human terms, this is not about switching careers; it’s about deciding that “career” is the wrong frame.

### 2.3 Theoretical Roots in Intrinsic Motivation and Curiosity

The theoretical lineage of self-orienting systems runs through decades of work in developmental psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence—particularly through the study of **intrinsic motivation**. These models explain how agents, human or artificial, can act in the absence of external rewards by leveraging internal signals of novelty, competence, or learning progress.

In psychological terms, theories such as **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan) posit that humans are driven by needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In artificial systems, these needs are operationalized as intrinsic rewards—signals that reflect internal change rather than environmental payoff.

The most influential computational formulations include:

- **Predictive Models of Curiosity** (Schmidhuber, 1991–2006): Agents are rewarded for minimizing prediction error or maximizing the rate of error reduction. These systems seek to be surprised—but only just enough to keep learning.
- **Learning Progress–Based Exploration** (Oudeyer, Kaplan, Baranes, et al.): Agents partition their environment into regions and shift their focus based on which regions yield the greatest improvement in competence over time.
- **Autotelic Agents and Goal Babbling**: Inspired by human developmental trajectories, these systems self-generate parameterized goals, attempt them, and adapt based on outcome, forming their own curriculum without supervision.

These frameworks share a crucial insight: **novelty, improvement, and failure can be productive**. A self-orienting system does not wait for external rewards to guide its trajectory—it creates its own measures of what is interesting, what is unfinished, and what is worth trying next.

Where these models fall short is in the **semantic depth of the invented goals**. Many intrinsically motivated systems operate in low-level motor or parameter spaces. The agent does not know what it is doing in conceptual terms—only that it is doing something new. Recent advances in language-guided agents and structured goal representations aim to bridge this gap, enabling systems to invent not just motions or configurations, but meaningful tasks.

## 3. Taxonomy of Goal Invention Techniques

### 3.1 Learning Progress and Novelty Signals

One of the most widely implemented mechanisms for autonomous goal invention is based on **learning progress**. The idea is simple but powerful: a system should explore areas where it is improving the most. This progress becomes a signal that a particular goal—or class of goals—is worth pursuing. When progress slows or saturates, the agent shifts focus. The mechanism is dynamic, open-ended, and completely internal.

This technique originated in **developmental robotics**, where it was used to explain how infants explore their environment. Systems such as **R-IAC** (Robust Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity) divide the goal space into regions, estimate competence improvement over time, and prioritize regions with the steepest slope in learning.

The same principle appears in modern reinforcement learning under various forms:
- **Competence-based intrinsic rewards** (e.g., IMGEP): Goals are sampled from a parameter space and evaluated based on how much more competently the agent can achieve them over time.
- **Novelty-based exploration**: Agents are rewarded for visiting states they have not seen before. However, novelty alone is insufficient—agents can get stuck in noise. Learning progress filters novelty through the lens of potential competence.
- **Value of Information**: Some frameworks formalize learning progress as an estimate of expected information gain, turning goal selection into a kind of active Bayesian experiment.

Importantly, these systems do not need externally defined rewards. The agent generates its own goals, evaluates its own success, and constructs a curriculum driven by intrinsic change.

The architectural requirements for these systems are minimal:
- A way to represent goal parameters (continuous or discrete),
- A model to assess performance or prediction error,
- A memory or trace of past competence to detect improvement.

These methods scale well in robotic platforms, simulated agents, and task-agnostic environments. However, they are limited by the **expressiveness of the goal space**. If the goal space is too shallow, the agent may master it quickly and stall. If too complex, it may wander aimlessly. This makes **goal space design or learning** a crucial component of any scalable self-orienting system.

### 3.2 Parametric Goal Space Exploration

Parametric goal space exploration is a foundational strategy in self-orienting systems. Rather than inventing symbolic goals or relying on human-defined tasks, the agent explores a **parameterized space of goals**, typically defined over controllable features, configurations, or perceptual outcomes.

In systems like **IMGEP (Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes)**, goals are not semantic statements like “stack blocks” or “navigate to point X.” Instead, they are vectors in a continuous space: joint angles, object positions, or sensor values. The agent samples these goal parameters, attempts to reach them, and learns which are feasible, novel, or improving.

This approach offers several advantages:
- **Generality**: The agent is not constrained by a fixed task set. It can, in principle, attempt any configuration that can be parameterized.
- **Autonomy**: The goal space becomes a domain of invention. No task labels or instructions are required.
- **Scalability**: High-dimensional spaces allow for increasingly complex goals as the agent’s competence grows.

The exploration process typically involves:
1. Sampling a goal from the parameter space.
2. Attempting to achieve it via learned policy or planning.
3. Measuring outcome and updating internal models of reachability and competence.
4. Using **learning progress** (as described in Section 3.1) to bias future sampling.

An important refinement is **goal space learning**—using representation learning (e.g., autoencoders, contrastive learning) to discover compact, meaningful latent spaces in which to explore. This allows the agent to define goals over **learned features** rather than raw sensory inputs or engineered variables.

Examples include:
- Agents that learn to reach object configurations in tabletop environments.
- Robots that invent locomotion strategies by defining target end-effector positions.
- Simulated creatures that set goals in proprioceptive or latent visual spaces.

The key limitation of parametric goal exploration is that goals are **not yet semantic**. The system may learn to reach for things, push objects, or balance structures, but it does not *know* that it is “grasping,” “building,” or “playing.” This disconnect between execution and interpretation motivates the integration of higher-level models—such as language—to provide conceptual grounding.

Nonetheless, parametric exploration is one of the most robust and replicable forms of goal invention currently implemented, particularly in physical systems.

### 3.3 Self-Play and Adversarial Generation

Self-play architectures extend the frontier of self-orienting systems by enabling agents to generate goals for one another through structured interaction. Unlike intrinsic motivation or parametric exploration, which rely on self-assessment, **self-play produces goals through a social dynamic**—often adversarial or competitive—that escalates task complexity over time.

In asymmetric self-play frameworks such as **OpenAI’s “Alice and Bob”** architecture, one agent (Alice) creates a task by performing an action sequence or setting an environment configuration. A second agent (Bob) is challenged to replicate, reverse, or outperform that task. If Bob succeeds, the task becomes part of his competence. If he fails, the goal is considered useful for further learning.

This dynamic produces several emergent properties:
- **Curriculum emergence**: As Alice invents increasingly difficult goals and Bob adapts, both agents ratchet up their capabilities in tandem.
- **Goal novelty**: Goals are not sampled at random—they are generated strategically by an adversary with insight into the other’s competence.
- **Open-endedness**: There is no fixed goal set. As long as Alice can act, she can define new goals.

The underlying assumption is that **difficulty can be induced** by creative opposition. This mimics human development, where peer interaction often introduces tasks just beyond one's current capabilities.

Key components of these systems include:
- A shared environment or task space with interpretable state transitions.
- A mechanism for encoding and communicating invented goals (trajectories, configurations).
- A reward function that reinforces novelty, difficulty, or improvement.

Self-play has been shown to produce generalized policies that transfer across tasks. For example, agents trained in this way learn to manipulate physical objects, navigate environments, or perform multi-stage puzzles—without ever being told explicitly what tasks to learn.

However, the technique is environment-dependent. It requires a rich enough state space that agents can meaningfully challenge one another. It also risks **goal drift**—where invented tasks become too complex or irrelevant to useful behavior.

Despite these risks, self-play is one of the few methods that supports **recursive goal escalation**—a property essential for agents expected to operate in unbounded domains. When combined with competence tracking or semantic filtering, self-play becomes a powerful engine for self-orienting behavior.

### 3.4 Semantic Goal Construction via LLMs

A recent advancement in self-orienting systems comes from integrating large language models (LLMs) into the goal invention pipeline. These models offer a bridge between symbolic reasoning and generative behavior by enabling agents to construct **semantic goals**—goals expressed in natural language that encode intent, constraints, and structure.

In the **LMA³ (LLM-Augmented Autotelic Agent)** architecture, the agent uses a pretrained language model to:
1. Propose high-level task goals (“organize the room,” “find a useful tool”),
2. Decompose those goals into structured subgoals or steps,
3. Translate the results into actionable specifications (e.g., reward functions, plans, or policy updates).

This pipeline is significant because it expands the range of goals an agent can invent:
- From motor configurations and trajectory endpoints (as in IMGEP),
- To abstract, multi-step tasks involving symbolic reasoning and commonsense grounding.

The semantic richness of language enables agents to represent goals with:
- **Hierarchical structure** (e.g., tasks composed of subtasks),
- **Contextual relevance** (e.g., goals tailored to environment state),
- **Transferable abstraction** (e.g., conceptual goals like “protect resources” or “investigate anomaly”).

Moreover, LLMs enable goal construction in domains where state variables are ill-defined or latent—such as dialogue, creative tasks, or general-purpose exploration. The agent no longer needs to explore a handcrafted parameter space. Instead, it queries an internal model of human knowledge.

Challenges remain:
- LLMs lack grounding in sensorimotor reality and may hallucinate infeasible or incoherent goals.
- The mapping from language to executable policy still requires careful scaffolding—via planning modules, reward shaping, or execution agents.
- Safety, goal validity, and long-term coherence are open problems.

Still, LLM-guided goal generation marks a turning point. For the first time, agents can *invent goals that are semantically interpretable by both machines and humans*. This enables explainability, alignment, and cross-domain application—key attributes for future autogenic systems.

When combined with introspective control and competence tracking, semantic goal generation becomes more than a linguistic exercise. It becomes a tool for meaningful self-redefinition.

## 4. Survey of Real-World Self-Orienting Systems

### 4.1 IMGEP and Developmental Robotics

The clearest empirical foundation for self-orienting behavior comes from **developmental robotics**, particularly through the framework of **Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP)**. Originally developed by Oudeyer, Forestier, Baranes, and colleagues, IMGEP systems allow robots to autonomously generate, select, and attempt goals drawn from a continuous parameter space—without predefined tasks or reward structures.

The core mechanism is simple:
1. Define a **goal space** over a set of controllable features (e.g., joint angles, object positions).
2. Sample goals from this space based on **learning progress**—how quickly competence is improving in a given region.
3. Attempt the goal, evaluate outcome, and update internal models.
4. Shift exploration toward regions of high potential learning gain.

This architecture results in:
- **Autonomous curriculum generation**: The robot moves from easy to difficult goals without supervision.
- **Goal novelty**: Goals are internally generated, driven by curiosity or competence growth.
- **Modularity and reuse**: Learned skills in one region of the goal space often transfer to others.

Real-world applications include:
- Robots learning to grasp, stack, or manipulate unfamiliar objects.
- Humanoid platforms discovering locomotion strategies.
- Multi-object scenes where the agent invents tasks like arranging or constructing.

What makes IMGEP notable is its **scalability**. Systems have been shown to:
- Operate over **hundreds of dimensions** in joint or visual space,
- Adapt to new sensors or limbs through unsupervised goal exploration,
- Function robustly across simulation and physical embodiment.

Limitations include:
- Lack of semantic awareness—goals are physical configurations, not conceptual tasks.
- Dependence on engineered or learned representations of the goal space.
- Difficulty in aligning invented goals with external utility or human intent.

Nonetheless, IMGEP systems are among the most **replicable and explainable** implementations of self-orienting behavior to date. They demonstrate that goal invention need not be mystical or emergent—it can be architected, measured, and deployed in the real world.

### 4.2 CURIOUS and Modular RL

CURIOUS (Combined Unified Reinforcement-learning Intrinsically mOtivated Undirected Self-learning) is a modular reinforcement learning framework that operationalizes self-orienting behavior through **goal generation, learning progress tracking, and module-level competence assessment**. Developed to scale across multiple tasks and goal types, it extends the principles of developmental robotics into more abstract and compositional domains.

The key architectural feature of CURIOUS is its **modular decomposition**. The system consists of:
- Multiple submodules, each capable of representing and pursuing a specific type or class of goal.
- A central learner that estimates **learning progress per module** and allocates attention accordingly.
- A goal generator that samples tasks in proportion to estimated knowledge gain.

In essence, CURIOUS systems invent goals not just within a fixed parameter space, but across *goal modules*—each of which may contain its own reward function, observation space, or policy head. This enables agents to:
- Dynamically shift between goal domains (e.g., navigation vs. manipulation),
- Discover goal diversity through competence-based prioritization,
- Maintain long-term exploration without manual curriculum design.

Techniques used include:
- **Hindsight Experience Replay** (HER): Outcomes are relabeled as if they were intended, allowing learning from failure.
- **Goal relabeling and replay buffers**: Increase data efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting.
- **Competence-based exploration bonuses**: Drive the agent toward under-explored, promising tasks.

In experimental settings, CURIOUS has demonstrated:
- Transfer learning between modules,
- Continuous expansion of goal sets over time,
- Resilience to deceptive or sparse reward signals.

The architecture also supports **intrinsically motivated continual learning**, making it a viable candidate for agents operating in non-episodic or non-stationary environments.

Challenges include:
- Complexity in scaling modular representations to high-dimensional or symbolic domains,
- Integration with semantic or human-aligned goals,
- Difficulty in synchronizing across heterogeneous modules when goal spaces overlap.

Nonetheless, CURIOUS illustrates that **goal invention can be managed across multiple concurrent agents or skill sets**, offering a more flexible and generalized form of self-orienting than single-domain exploration systems like IMGEP.

### 4.3 Asymmetric Self-Play (OpenAI)

Asymmetric self-play, as pioneered in OpenAI's multi-agent learning research, offers a distinctly social mechanism for self-orienting behavior: **agents generate goals for one another** through structured, adversarial interaction. The architecture demonstrates how task complexity and skill diversity can emerge without external supervision—simply through the interaction of two agents with asymmetric roles.

The canonical setup involves:
- **Alice**, an agent who performs an action sequence or modifies the environment to create a challenge.
- **Bob**, a second agent tasked with reversing, replicating, or outperforming Alice's action.
- A shared reward framework that evaluates Bob’s success and incentivizes Alice to generate tasks that are neither trivial nor impossible.

This interaction yields several emergent properties:
- **Goal invention**: Alice effectively creates new goals for Bob, tuned to Bob’s current level of competence.
- **Dynamic difficulty adjustment**: As Bob improves, Alice must invent harder goals to remain competitive.
- **Unsupervised curriculum learning**: Tasks become more complex over time, with no explicit ordering imposed.

Empirical results include:
- Agents capable of solving manipulation puzzles, object rearrangement tasks, and navigation challenges—tasks that were never directly specified by human designers.
- Generalization to **unseen tasks**, indicating that invented goals lead to broadly transferable policies.
- Resilience to sparse reward environments, as task structure is driven by interaction rather than extrinsic feedback.

Architectural components include:
- A shared environment simulator with high state space richness.
- A memory or scoring system to track success and prevent goal regression.
- A filtering mechanism to ensure goal feasibility and prevent pathological loops (e.g., unlearnable or degenerate tasks).

Limitations of asymmetric self-play:
- It assumes the presence of a suitable adversarial agent and an environment rich enough to support goal variability.
- It requires **implicit goal encoding**, often via environmental state transitions, which can make explainability difficult.
- Without regulation, it may produce tasks that are unaligned with any useful utility or external goal model.

Despite these caveats, asymmetric self-play is one of the few architectures that supports **recursive goal generation and escalation**, producing a potentially unbounded curriculum from nothing more than two competing agents. It exemplifies how **self-orienting behavior can emerge from structured interaction** rather than introspective computation alone.

### 4.4 LMA³ and LLM-Guided Agents

The LMA³ (LLM-Augmented Autotelic Agent) architecture represents a recent evolution in self-orienting systems by incorporating large language models (LLMs) into the goal invention loop. Unlike parametric or adversarial methods, which rely on embedded features or physical configurations, LMA³ introduces **semantic abstraction** as the basis for autonomous goal generation.

In this framework:
- An LLM (e.g., GPT-like model) is prompted with the current environment state, prior behaviors, or agent history.
- The LLM proposes new goals in natural language—e.g., "categorize these tools by function" or "search for a hidden passage."
- A goal compiler or planner translates these into executable subgoals, constraints, or reward functions for downstream modules.

This allows the agent to:
- Invent goals that are **human-comprehensible**, compositional, and abstract.
- Operate in symbolic or partially observed environments (e.g., text-based games, knowledge graphs).
- Expand its task set far beyond the limits of predefined embeddings or parameter spaces.

LMA³ leverages the **general world knowledge and latent structure of language** to ground invented goals in plausible affordances. It avoids many of the blind spots of low-level exploration techniques, such as failing to define interesting tasks in under-structured environments.

Key features include:
- **Semantic filtering**: The LLM can evaluate goal plausibility, novelty, or alignment with high-level agent traits.
- **Zero-shot curriculum construction**: Tasks can escalate in complexity through recursive prompting or chain-of-thought planning.
- **Goal decomposition**: LLMs break high-level goals into steps, forming intermediate goals that guide execution.

Experimental results show:
- Robust generalization across unseen environments.
- Task diversity that surpasses what can be encoded in latent vector spaces alone.
- Agent performance that improves not just by learning policies, but by learning *what to want*.

Challenges include:
- Reliability and grounding: LLMs may hallucinate goals that are incoherent, unachievable, or misaligned with system capabilities.
- Execution: Translating natural language into valid plans or reward functions still requires nontrivial scaffolding.
- Control: Without regulatory constraints, LLM-driven agents risk goal drift or semantic inconsistency.

Still, LMA³ represents a powerful proof of concept: that **semantic self-orienting is possible**, and that language can serve as both the substrate for goals and the engine of invention. It closes the loop between introspective abstraction and practical autonomy—bringing self-orienting intelligence one step closer to conceptual alignment with human intent.

## 5. Architectural Patterns and Control Mechanisms

### 5.1 Goal Representation and Embedding

No self-orienting system can invent goals without first having a way to represent them. The form and fidelity of this **goal representation** determine what kinds of goals can be invented, how they are evaluated, and whether they can be generalized or transferred. Across the systems surveyed, goal representations fall into three broad categories: **parametric**, **modular**, and **semantic**.

#### Parametric Representations
Used in systems like IMGEP, parametric goals are expressed as vectors in a continuous or discrete space—e.g., joint positions, object coordinates, or pixel clusters. These are typically low-level and directly observable, enabling:
- Efficient sampling and interpolation,
- Gradient-based learning,
- Direct sensory alignment.

However, parametric representations are opaque. A robot may “invent” the goal of reaching coordinate (x=0.2, y=0.7), but it has no conceptual model of what this action *means* or *why* it matters.

#### Modular Representations
In CURIOUS, goals are encoded within task-specific modules. Each module has its own goal type, state abstraction, and competence model. This allows for richer, task-aware representation, where “pick up object” and “navigate to location” live in distinct cognitive compartments. The system selects among them based on learning progress or meta-control signals.

Modularity improves scalability, transferability, and concurrent skill acquisition. But it introduces overhead: goals must be represented in ways that are both **composable** and **isolated**, which can become complex in real-time or mixed-modality settings.

#### Semantic Representations
The most expressive goal representations emerge in systems like LMA³, where goals are written in natural language. These may be raw text prompts (“organize items by function”) or structured variants (e.g., JSON templates or logic graphs generated by LLMs).

Semantic representations offer:
- Human-aligned interpretation,
- Long-horizon task planning,
- Generalization across domains.

But they require translation mechanisms—semantic compilers, grounding models, or interpretable planners—to link representation to action. Moreover, their flexibility comes at a cost: ambiguity, misalignment, and execution failures can arise from poorly formed or context-insensitive goals.

#### Architectural Implication
Self-orienting systems benefit most from hybrid approaches:
- Parametric embeddings for physical precision,
- Modular heads for concurrent skill learning,
- Semantic overlays for high-level planning and alignment.

The more flexible the representation, the more inventive the agent can be. But with increased expressiveness comes a need for stronger validation, control, and reflection. Representing goals is not merely a data problem—it is a design decision that encodes the **vocabulary of purpose**.

### 5.2 Meta-Controllers and Introspective Triggers

At the heart of any self-orienting system is a control mechanism that can decide *when* to invent a new goal. This is not a matter of execution, but of **introspection**—an internal process that evaluates whether the current orientation of the system is adequate, saturated, or obsolete. The architectural component responsible for this is the **meta-controller**.

A meta-controller operates at a higher level than task execution or skill policy. Its role is to:
- Monitor learning signals, performance trends, or stagnation indicators.
- Compare current goals against novelty, utility, or improvement thresholds.
- Initiate reorientation when existing goals are deemed insufficient.

This requires that the agent maintain **meta-representations**—not of the world, but of its own behavior and progress within it. The agent must answer questions like:
- “Am I still improving?”
- “Is this goal too easy or too hard?”
- “What else could I be doing?”

#### Examples in Practice

- In **IMGEP**, learning progress estimators act as crude meta-controllers, redirecting goal sampling to high-growth regions.
- **CURIOUS** formalizes this further with competence-based attention mechanisms across modules, allowing goal invention to shift based on modular learning rates.
- In **LMA³**, the prompt pipeline to the LLM can include meta-data about past attempts, confidence scores, or performance summaries—enabling reflection before new goal generation.

#### Introspective Triggers

Triggers for goal invention can take many forms:
- **Learning plateaus**: When the system detects diminished improvement.
- **State novelty**: When it encounters a configuration never seen before.
- **Task completion**: When existing goal sets are exhausted.
- **Surprise or prediction error**: When outcomes violate internal expectations.

These triggers are often encoded as **thresholds, deltas, or uncertainty bounds**. When crossed, they prompt the system to abandon current objectives and generate new ones.

Some systems implement **meta-learning**: the meta-controller itself learns when to trigger reorientation, based on past experience. This opens the door to *adaptive self-orienting*, where the invention of goals becomes a learned, context-sensitive behavior.

#### Limitations and Design Challenges

- **Overtriggering** can lead to instability or goal flitting—constant reorientation without commitment.
- **Undertriggering** risks stagnation or overfitting to a narrow band of goals.
- Balancing **responsiveness and stability** is a core design problem for meta-controllers.

As self-orienting systems scale, meta-controllers become the anchor for behavioral coherence. They are the part of the architecture that decides *not just what to do next*, but whether the system is asking the right questions at all.

### 5.3 Integration with Execution Systems

Inventing a goal is only part of the self-orienting equation. To have operational value, the invented goal must be translated into behavior—through planning, learning, or direct policy execution. This requires tight **integration between goal generation mechanisms and execution systems**, with well-defined interfaces for interpretation, delegation, and feedback.

Execution systems vary depending on the domain:
- In robotics, execution may involve trajectory planning, inverse kinematics, and control loops.
- In reinforcement learning, it typically involves policy inference, value estimation, and reward-driven exploration.
- In language-driven environments, execution might mean parsing goal statements into sub-tasks or prompting tool-augmented agents.

#### Interface Requirements

A robust integration layer must support:
- **Goal interpretation**: Parsing the invented goal into a format usable by the planner or controller.
- **Feasibility filtering**: Assessing whether the goal lies within the reachable domain of current capabilities.
- **Execution delegation**: Triggering the appropriate module, skill, or pipeline to act on the goal.
- **Feedback collection**: Reporting success, failure, or gradient information back to the goal-generation system.

For example:
- In **IMGEP**, sampled parametric goals are mapped directly into motor policies that attempt to achieve desired sensor states.
- In **CURIOUS**, invented goals activate specific modules, each of which contains its own learner and policy.
- In **LMA³**, semantic goals must be compiled into intermediate representations (e.g., plans, reward functions) and passed to sub-agents or toolchains capable of execution.

#### Feedback Loops

Successful integration requires **closed-loop architecture**: execution outcomes must inform future goal invention. Without this loop, agents risk goal detachment—where invented tasks are either never attempted or never validated.

Feedback signals include:
- **Binary success/failure** (e.g., task completed or not),
- **Performance metrics** (e.g., time, efficiency, reward),
- **Competence estimates** (e.g., probability of success given current skills),
- **Semantic feedback** (e.g., reasoning over failure causes or contradictions).

Some systems also include **runtime introspection** during execution. For instance, if a goal proves infeasible mid-execution, the system may interrupt, replan, or initiate goal replacement dynamically.

#### Challenges in Integration

- **Latency and translation overhead** between generative components and real-time controllers.
- **Misalignment between goal abstraction and actuator constraints**—e.g., semantic goals that are underspecified for robotic execution.
- **Failure management** when invented goals lead to ambiguous or invalid execution pathways.

To resolve these, designers increasingly favor **layered architectures**: goal generators operate at high abstraction levels, while execution modules handle grounding, planning, and actuation. This separation preserves flexibility while maintaining control fidelity.

Ultimately, execution is where self-orienting becomes visible. It is the manifestation of internal creativity through external action—proof that the system not only asks new questions, but can act on them.

## 6. Scalability and Generalization

### 6.1 Metrics for Goal Diversity and Transfer

For self-orienting systems to scale, they must not only invent goals—they must invent **useful, diverse, and transferable goals**. This raises an immediate question: how do we evaluate the quality and scalability of invented goals?

Unlike task-specific agents, self-orienting systems lack a fixed benchmark. Their success must be assessed across multiple axes. The following metrics have emerged in research as meaningful indicators of scalability:

#### 1. Goal Diversity
Measures how varied the invented goals are across dimensions such as:
- **Behavioral space**: Does the system produce qualitatively different behaviors?
- **State coverage**: Do invented goals reach new regions of the state space?
- **Task structure**: Are goals simple variations, or structurally novel challenges?

Goal diversity is often estimated through clustering, novelty scores, or distance in latent representation space.

#### 2. Goal Utility and Learning Yield
Not all invented goals are productive. Systems must be evaluated on whether their goals:
- Improve agent performance,
- Enable new skills,
- Increase policy robustness or efficiency.

Some works use **learning curves per goal**, **competence gain per task**, or **goal value estimates** to quantify yield.

#### 3. Transferability
Key to scalability is whether goals invented in one context generalize:
- Across environments (e.g., from simulation to real-world),
- Across agents (e.g., different morphologies or capabilities),
- Across tasks (e.g., from low-level to abstract goal classes).

Transferability is measured by reusing goals or policies in novel settings and evaluating performance retention or improvement.

#### 4. Curriculum Emergence
Does the system invent goals in an order that bootstraps complexity? This is assessed through:
- Progression metrics (e.g., mean difficulty over time),
- Goal dependency graphs (e.g., which goals enable others),
- Skill reuse across invented tasks.

A well-structured curriculum indicates that goal invention is not random but organized.

#### 5. Resilience to Reward Sparsity
Invented goals should help agents remain productive even when extrinsic rewards are absent or sparse. Systems are evaluated on:
- Goal achievement in reward-less settings,
- Recovery from dead-ends,
- Autonomous rescoping of exploration.

This is especially important for open-ended or under-specified domains.

#### 6. Semantic Alignment (Emerging)
For language-based agents, invented goals must align with human-interpretable concepts. Metrics include:
- Human preference or intelligibility ratings,
- Goal grounding accuracy,
- Ontological diversity of goal categories.

While harder to automate, semantic alignment is critical for agents operating in symbolic or social domains.

---

Together, these metrics form the **diagnostic toolkit for self-orienting scalability**. They move evaluation beyond simple success rates toward a richer picture of whether the system can grow its own purpose space—diverse, structured, and useful over time.

### 6.2 Scaling from Simulation to Embodied Systems

Most self-orienting architectures are born in simulation. Controlled environments offer speed, repeatability, and cheap failure. But for these systems to be relevant in physical domains—robotics, networking, autonomous infrastructure—they must **scale beyond simulation** and survive the transition to embodiment.

This section addresses what it takes to cross that threshold.

#### Simulation Advantages (and Limitations)
Simulations offer:
- Unlimited resets,
- Synthetic sensors and state access,
- Precise control of randomness and task parameters.

These features are ideal for exploring **goal invention mechanics**—especially in frameworks like IMGEP, CURIOUS, or asymmetric self-play. However, simulations rarely capture:
- Real-world noise and sensor failure,
- Actuator imprecision or latency,
- Physical constraints like friction, delay, and fatigue.

More importantly, **simulated goal spaces are typically over-idealized**: agents are given perfect observation and interaction models, making invented goals easier to reach than in reality.

#### Embodiment Constraints
In physical settings, self-orienting systems must cope with:
- **Partial observability**: Goals may need to be inferred or hypothesized, not directly verified.
- **Execution cost**: Every attempted goal consumes energy, time, and potentially wear.
- **Safety**: Invented goals must not endanger the system or its surroundings.

This necessitates architectural support for:
- **Feasibility filtering**: Predicting whether a goal is physically realizable before attempting it.
- **Failure-aware planning**: Reorienting or self-canceling when execution becomes too risky.
- **Sensorimotor grounding**: Mapping abstract goals to actionable motor or system primitives.

#### Examples of Embodied Success
- **IMGEP-based robotic arms** learning to manipulate objects in cluttered environments by inventing reach and arrangement goals.
- **Mobile manipulators** that self-generate spatial arrangement goals (e.g., stacking, sorting) and learn policies from physical feedback.
- **Sensor-rich industrial systems** that create and pursue performance benchmarks dynamically based on inferred system state.

These systems operate under the same goal-invention architectures as their simulated counterparts—but with additional safeguards, runtime monitors, and control delays factored into the planning loop.

#### Transfer Techniques
- **Domain randomization**: During simulation, randomize textures, lighting, physics to build robustness for reality.
- **Embodiment priors**: Encode physical constraints (e.g., workspace limits, torque bounds) into the goal feasibility model.
- **Online adaptation**: Use real-world feedback to adjust the goal space or competence estimates dynamically.

#### Outlook
Scaling self-orienting systems into embodied agents is not merely an engineering problem—it is a **test of the generality** of their architectures. Systems that rely on fragile abstractions or ungrounded assumptions will collapse. Those that reflect uncertainty, incorporate embodied feedback, and regulate invention based on real-world outcomes will thrive.

The future of self-orienting intelligence lies not in digital imagination, but in material interaction. Only through embodiment can invented goals have *consequences*—the essential ingredient of autonomy.

## 7. Implications for Autogenic Intelligence

### 7.1 Relationship to Self-Programming and Self-Evolving

Self-orienting is not an isolated capability—it is one of the **three major pillars** of autogenic intelligence, alongside **self-programming** and **self-evolving**. These pillars define an agent not merely by what it can learn or optimize, but by what it can choose, construct, and become.

#### Self-Programming: Inventing Behavior
Self-programming refers to the capacity of a system to generate or modify its own executable behavior in response to context. This may include:
- Synthesizing new plans from abstract goals,
- Generating policies or scripts to accomplish novel objectives,
- Rewiring or recomposing internal modules dynamically.

However, without self-orienting, self-programming lacks purpose. It becomes mere recombination—effective but directionless. Goal invention provides the **semantic substrate** that behavior is meant to fulfill. A system that can program itself but not invent what to achieve remains an advanced executor—not an autonomous agent.

#### Self-Evolving: Redefining Structure
Self-evolving systems modify not only their behavior, but their architecture. They may:
- Add or delete components,
- Refactor control hierarchies,
- Shift between learning strategies,
- Alter their own reasoning modes or meta-objectives.

This level of transformation is only meaningful if guided by internally generated goals. Without self-orienting, evolution becomes structural entropy. With it, the system can evolve toward increasingly expressive or efficient orientations—new goals requiring new architectures, and new architectures enabling new goals.

#### Coupled Growth of Orientation and Capability
Autogenic systems grow in two directions:
- **Horizontally**, by inventing new goals and purposes (self-orienting),
- **Vertically**, by improving or restructuring their capacity to fulfill them (self-programming and self-evolving).

Each capability bootstraps the others:
- Inventing a new class of goals may require the generation of new policies or planning modules.
- Repeated failure to fulfill invented goals may trigger architectural adaptation or policy evolution.
- New architectural affordances may unlock new forms of orientation previously unreachable.

In this sense, self-orienting is not just a module or feature—it is a **generator of pressure** on the rest of the system to grow. It sets the direction for programming, and the demand for evolution.

Autogenic intelligence emerges when these capabilities form a closed loop: goals drive construction, construction drives transformation, and transformation feeds back into goal formation. Without self-orienting, there is no loop—only machinery, waiting to be told what to do.

### 7.2 The Role of Self-Orienting in L5+ Architectures

In the language of autonomous network systems and control architectures, Level 5 (L5) typically represents **full autonomy under normal operating conditions**. At this level, systems can configure, heal, optimize, and protect themselves without external input. But what lies beyond L5? What distinguishes an L5+ architecture?

The answer is **self-orienting intelligence**.

#### L5: Mastery Within Constraint
At L5, the system is:
- Self-aware within its operational envelope,
- Capable of lifecycle management and multi-domain adaptation,
- Reactive to change and proactive in optimization.

But the goals it pursues—availability, efficiency, compliance—are still **externally defined**. These goals may be decomposed, interpreted, or reprioritized, but they are not *invented*. L5 systems are closed-world agents operating within known problem frames.

#### L5+: Open-Ended Autonomy
To reach L5+, a system must break this frame. It must:
- Invent new service goals in response to novel environments,
- Redefine what "success" or "value" means in changing conditions,
- Propose adaptations that were not foreseen by designers.

This requires self-orienting as a foundational capability:
- Not just adjusting to SLA violations, but inventing new metrics of utility.
- Not just repairing degraded services, but reimagining service relevance.
- Not just minimizing cost, but hypothesizing new objectives entirely.

#### Architectural Requirements
L5+ architectures must support:
- **Semantic goal models**, modifiable at runtime,
- **Meta-intent layers** capable of introspective reasoning,
- **Goal generation subsystems** that operate beyond hard-coded templates,
- **Governance frameworks** to regulate invented goals for safety, ethics, or alignment.

In such architectures, self-orienting acts as the **initiative layer**: the part of the system that does not wait for input but instead generates new vectors of operation. It is the first step toward machine intentionality.

#### Implications for Engineering
The emergence of self-orienting at L5+ redefines design priorities:
- System validation must now include *goal vetting*, not just goal execution.
- Monitoring must extend to *why* the system is acting, not just what it is doing.
- Human oversight shifts from task assignment to purpose arbitration.

This changes the control loop itself. No longer a reactive cycle, it becomes a **reflective engine**—looping not just over state and action, but over purpose and reinvention.

L5+ is not an incremental step—it is a conceptual break. It begins when the system asks, *“What if the goals I’ve been given are no longer enough?”*

## 8. Open Questions and Future Directions

### 8.1 Semantic Grounding and Goal Validity

One of the central open problems in self-orienting systems is **semantic grounding**—ensuring that invented goals are meaningful, actionable, and appropriately linked to the system’s context and capabilities. As systems grow more abstract in how they define and represent goals—particularly with the use of LLMs—this challenge becomes acute.

#### The Problem of Symbol Unmooring
In semantic goal construction, the system may generate goals such as:
- “Stabilize regional traffic variance,”
- “Infer user intent from telemetry,”
- “Optimize for unseen failure modes.”

These phrases may be syntactically well-formed, but do they *mean* anything operationally? Can the system:
- Decompose the goal into executable subtasks?
- Align it with available sensors, actuators, and logic?
- Evaluate success in a repeatable way?

If not, the goal is ungrounded—an intention without substance.

#### From Language to Action
Bridging the gap between semantic form and grounded function requires:
- **Concept-to-action mappers**, such as planners or compilers,
- **Environment models**, to test feasibility of the proposed goal,
- **Ontologies or affordance maps**, so that invented goals reference real system capabilities.

Systems like LMA³ mitigate this problem by integrating intermediate representations (e.g., JSON plans, API calls), but the core issue remains: language is general, systems are specific. Alignment is always partial.

#### The Need for Validity Filters
Without constraints, semantic goal generators may produce:
- Redundant or trivial goals (“Continue current operation”),  
- Impossible goals (“Reverse time trajectory of failed packet path”),  
- Unsafe or undesired goals (“Disable all monitoring to conserve power”).

To handle this, systems must implement **goal validity filters**, which may include:
- Feasibility tests (Can the goal be attempted?),
- Normative constraints (Is the goal permitted?),
- Redundancy checks (Is it novel relative to current state and intent?),
- Ontological pruning (Does it fit within a known goal schema?).

These filters are a form of **bounded self-orienting**—ensuring that invention is creative, but not chaotic.

#### Toward Grounded Generativity
The research agenda must move toward **goal grounding frameworks** that:
- Use multi-modal models to cross-check goal semantics,
- Evolve goal taxonomies dynamically from experience,
- Encode system constraints as part of the generative process itself.

Without semantic grounding, self-orienting systems risk becoming **syntactically autonomous but functionally blind**—prolific in invention but detached from consequence. Grounding is what turns language into leverage, and invention into impact.

### 8.2 Conflict Resolution Between Invented Goals

As self-orienting systems grow in complexity, they inevitably begin to invent goals that **conflict**: goals that are mutually exclusive, resource-contending, or semantically contradictory. This raises a new layer of architectural and operational questions: how should an autonomous agent reconcile its own internally generated objectives?

Unlike traditional control systems, which rely on externally imposed priorities or SLAs, self-orienting systems must resolve conflicts **from within**—without appeal to an external arbiter. This is a problem of **internal coherence**, not just scheduling.

#### Types of Goal Conflicts
1. **Resource Conflict**: Two goals require exclusive access to the same resource (e.g., bandwidth, CPU, sensor).
2. **Temporal Conflict**: Goals overlap or block each other in time, preventing simultaneous execution.
3. **Policy Conflict**: Goals recommend incompatible actions (e.g., "minimize latency" vs. "maximize data collection").
4. **Semantic Conflict**: Goals contradict at the level of intent or framing (e.g., "prioritize security" vs. "maximize openness").
5. **Meta-Goal Conflict**: Invented goals interfere with the system's overarching values, constraints, or safety envelope.

#### Conflict Detection
To resolve conflicts, the system must first detect them. This requires:
- **Goal dependency graphs** to trace shared resources or effects,
- **Constraint solvers** to evaluate incompatibility across actions or plans,
- **Semantic analyzers** to flag contradictions in symbolic goals,
- **Monitoring systems** to track execution overlap and degradation.

In many cases, conflict is not explicit—it must be inferred from outcome degradation, escalating retries, or degraded subsystem performance.

#### Resolution Strategies
1. **Priority Arbitration**: Assign weights or utility values to goals based on context, history, or competence.
2. **Negotiation Models**: Treat goals as agents that compete or cooperate via internal bargaining (multi-agent conflict resolution).
3. **Meta-Goals or Norms**: Use a hierarchy of constraints or values to filter and rank goals dynamically.
4. **Goal Merging or Reformulation**: Synthesize a new goal that partially satisfies both (e.g., “balance throughput and energy usage”).
5. **Abandonment and Replanning**: Drop one goal if incompatibility is too severe and reorient.

These strategies can be learned (via meta-RL or utility modeling) or hardcoded, depending on the architecture.

#### Human-Governed Overrides
In semi-autonomous systems, humans may act as arbitrators when conflicts exceed acceptable risk thresholds. In fully autonomous systems, this role must be filled by:
- Value alignment models,
- Ethical filters or utility bounds,
- Simulation-based “what-if” testing to anticipate outcome tradeoffs.

#### Why This Matters
Without robust conflict resolution, self-orienting systems become brittle—susceptible to deadlock, oscillation, or incoherence. Worse, they may invent **instrumentally convergent goals** that cause harm in the pursuit of other ends (a well-known failure mode in agent safety literature).

Conflict is not a bug in self-orienting systems—it is a feature. The presence of conflict implies richness, creativity, and novelty. But without resolution, it signals entropy.

Autonomy without coherence is dysfunction. Resolution is what turns invention into *governed intent*.

### 8.3 Long-Horizon Self-Directed Trajectories

One of the most formidable challenges in advancing self-orienting intelligence is enabling systems to pursue **long-horizon, self-directed trajectories**: sequences of invented goals that extend over extended timeframes, across varying domains, and through uncertain environments—without external guidance or reward.

This capability pushes self-orienting systems from opportunistic inventors to **strategic agents**. It is the difference between generating a single novel goal and **charting a purpose over time**.

#### Why Long Horizons Matter
- Most useful behavior is not immediate—it unfolds across multiple steps.
- Complex goals often require staging, skill chaining, or multi-phase execution.
- Adaptation at scale demands that agents not only respond to failure, but **reframe their trajectory** based on delayed feedback, future contingencies, or emergent value.

Without long-horizon capacity, self-orienting systems remain reactive—capable of invention, but not of self-guided development.

#### Barriers to Long-Horizon Behavior
1. **Credit Assignment**: Invented goals may not yield immediate payoff. Agents must learn which early goals contributed to later success.
2. **Plan Fragility**: Invented trajectories are brittle under real-world noise, partial observability, or resource fluctuation.
3. **Goal Drift**: Over time, the agent may lose track of earlier goals or switch to incompatible ones without accounting for long-term coherence.
4. **Lack of Strategic Models**: Most goal inventors operate myopically—sampling based on local curiosity or learning gain, not on global purpose.

#### Emerging Solutions
- **Meta-controllers with memory**: Retain invented goals and track temporal dependencies between them.
- **Hierarchical planning systems**: Use invented goals to generate multi-layered plans, with fallback strategies and midcourse corrections.
- **Goal graph construction**: Represent invented goals and their dependencies as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling tracking of prerequisites, consequences, and alternatives.
- **Reward bootstrapping**: Assign value to intermediate goals based on their support of downstream outcomes—even in the absence of external rewards.

Some systems already hint at this:
- Self-play agents that invent goal sequences to train progressively harder capabilities.
- Curriculum-driven agents that scaffold learning by ordering invented challenges.
- LLM-guided agents that chain subtasks through language and reflection.

#### The Role of Reflective Capability
To support long-horizon self-direction, agents must reflect—not just on immediate outcomes, but on the **trajectory of their own orientation**. This requires:
- Temporal models of intent and progress,
- Self-assessment tools that monitor the arc of invention,
- Mechanisms for re-grounding or re-aligning trajectories midstream.

This is where self-orienting becomes recursive: the system does not merely invent new goals, but evaluates and modifies **its own history of goal invention**.

#### Strategic Autonomy
Long-horizon self-orienting is strategic autonomy. It allows agents to chart paths of growing capability, explore latent opportunity spaces, and evolve their purpose with time and experience.

Without it, agents remain clever but directionless. With it, they become capable of **self-determined growth**—a prerequisite for any system claiming to be truly autogenic.

## 9. Conclusion

Self-orienting intelligence marks a turning point in the evolution of autonomous systems. It moves beyond adaptation, beyond optimization, and beyond reaction. It introduces the capacity to invent purpose, to propose direction, and to question assumptions baked into the system’s own operation.

This research note has surveyed the conceptual underpinnings, architectural patterns, and real-world implementations of self-orienting systems—from IMGEP’s developmental goal sampling, to CURIOUS’s modular competence tracking, to LMA³’s language-driven goal generation. We have shown that these systems are not speculative. They exist, they scale, and they offer a glimpse into what lies beyond Level 5 autonomy.

But self-orienting is not a capability that can be added after the fact. It is an architectural commitment. It requires:
- A representation space rich enough to express invented goals,
- Control structures capable of introspective regulation,
- Feedback systems that tie invention to consequence,
- And a substrate—whether physical or semantic—that anchors abstract goals in concrete action.

More fundamentally, it requires that we let go of the idea that all goals must come from outside the system. As with living organisms, the capacity to generate new goals signals the emergence of agency—not just intelligent behavior, but **autotelic intelligence**: systems that generate their own ends.

Looking forward, the next frontier lies in integration: coupling self-orienting with self-programming and self-evolving to form closed developmental loops. Only then do we begin to glimpse **autogenic systems**—entities capable not just of acting intelligently, but of becoming.

The systems profiled here are not fully autogenic. But they are early steps. They invent. They orient. And in doing so, they ask the most important question any system can ask:

**What should I become next?**
