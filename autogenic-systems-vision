## Autogenic Systems Vision

**by C.G. Djinovic**

**June 26, 2025**

As intelligent systems grow in complexity and autonomy, there emerges a need for architectures that not only act independently but also **originate their own goals, executable logic, and internal control structures**. These systems, which go beyond adaptation or optimization, are here termed **autogenic systems**—systems that generate their own purpose and pathways from within.

### What Does *Autogenic* Mean?

The term *autogenic* is derived from two Greek roots:
- **auto-** (αὐτός): meaning “self”[^6]
- **-genic** (γενής): meaning “producing” or “generating”[^5]

Literally, *autogenic* means **“self-generating.”** Unlike autonomous systems, which act on predefined goals or models, autogenic systems invent and synthesize their own operational objectives and behaviors in response to novelty, failure, or internal reflection.

This linguistic precision is supported by usage in multiple scientific disciplines. In psychology, *autogenic training* refers to a method where individuals self-induce relaxation through mental visualization, emphasizing self-originated physiological control[^3]. In ecology, *autogenic succession* refers to the internal biological processes that drive long-term changes in ecosystems—contrasted with *allogenic* (externally driven) processes[^2]. Both usages align with the sense of **internal causation** and **self-determined evolution**.

Autogenic systems, therefore, are not just systems that operate without human intervention. They are systems that can **construct and revise** their own goals, behaviors, and internal frameworks.

## How Autogenic Systems Differ from Other Autonomous Types

Autogenic systems are defined not simply by their ability to act without human intervention, but by their capacity to **originate goals, generate behavior, and evolve their own internal control logic**. This places them beyond other commonly discussed categories such as automated, autonomic, adaptive, or autonomous systems.

The following table highlights these distinctions:

| **System Type**   | **Behavior Scope**     | **Goal Origin**        | **Architecture Change**     | **Example**                          |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Automated**     | Executes predefined tasks | Human-defined         | Fixed                        | Scripting engine                     |
| **Autonomic**     | Maintains internal state | Human-defined         | No                           | Self-healing router                  |
| **Adaptive**      | Optimizes behavior       | Human-defined         | No                           | RL-based network slice manager       |
| **Autonomous**    | Pursues goals independently | Given or selected   | Partial                      | Intent-based domain controller       |
| **Autogenic**     | Invents and pursues new goals | Internally generated | Yes (self-evolving)         | Self-restructuring reasoning agent   |

### Defining Traits of Autogenic Systems

Autogenic systems exhibit four capabilities that distinguish them from prior types:

- **Self-orienting**: Inventing new goals that are not drawn from any predefined list or policy set.
- **Self-programming**: Synthesizing executable logic aligned with newly invented goals.
- **Self-evolving**: Altering their own reasoning architecture or behavior synthesis process.
- **Self-reflective**: Monitoring and regulating their own performance and reasoning patterns over time.

Where adaptive or autonomous systems respond to external change by choosing among existing strategies, autogenic systems **respond by creating new strategies and purposes**.

This leap—from selecting goals to **inventing them**—marks the defining boundary of autogenic intelligence.

## Theoretical Context and Related Concepts

Autogenic systems extend ideas already present in systems theory, biology, and cognitive science. While not synonymous with these earlier concepts, they share intellectual DNA with theories of **self-production**, **open-ended adaptation**, and **recursive self-modification**.

### Autopoiesis

The most directly related idea is **autopoiesis**, introduced by Maturana and Varela to describe biological systems—especially cells—that maintain and regenerate themselves through internal processes[^4]. In an autopoietic system:
- The system’s components are produced by internal operations.
- The system maintains its boundary and identity through self-production.

Autogenic systems inherit this principle of internal causation but go further: they not only **maintain themselves**, but also **generate new behavioral goals and logic structures**. In other words, autopoietic systems are **self-sustaining**, while autogenic systems are **self-reinventing**.

### Autogenic vs Autopoietic

| Feature                | Autopoietic System              | Autogenic System                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Self-maintenance       | Yes                              | Yes                                        |
| Self-reproduction      | Yes                              | Not required                               |
| Self-orienting         | No                               | Yes                                        |
| Self-programming       | No                               | Yes                                        |
| Self-evolving          | Possibly (biologically)          | Yes (explicit design feature)              |
| Intent generation      | No                               | Yes                                        |

### Open-Ended Learning and Generative Agents

Autogenic systems also connect with recent developments in **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** and **developmental robotics**, where the goal is to create agents capable of:
- **Exploring without fixed objectives**
- **Inventing new tasks and internal models**
- **Revising their learning architecture during runtime**

These goals parallel research in open-ended learning, intrinsically motivated goal generation, and meta-reasoning. Yet unlike most current generative AI systems (which produce outputs but not goals), autogenic systems must **synthesize purpose**, not just data.

They are not simply large language models or generative planners. They are **goal-generative systems** with the ability to **decide what to care about** and **how to act on it**, without external instruction.

### Philosophical Significance

In philosophy of mind and artificial life, autogenic systems intersect with discussions on **agency**, **intentionality**, and **selfhood**. By exhibiting internally generated directionality, they resemble what Daniel Dennett calls *intentional systems*—but without requiring human observers to assign meaning. The meaning **emerges from within**, through structural self-organization.

## Terminology Justification and Alternatives Considered

The term **autogenic** was chosen deliberately to express the notion of systems that generate goals, behavior, and control structures from within. It avoids conceptual ambiguity and aligns well with existing scientific uses.

### Why Not Autonomous?

While “autonomous” suggests operational independence, it does not imply **internal generativity**. Autonomous systems:
- Can act without human intervention,
- But typically **pursue externally defined goals**, or select among known alternatives.

Autogenic systems, by contrast:
- Invent new goals (self-orienting),
- Write new logic (self-programming),
- Transform their own control architectures (self-evolving).

Autonomy is about **independence of execution**. Autogenicity is about **independence of origin**.

### Other Terms Considered

| Term             | Pros                                         | Cons                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-generative** | Accurate functionally                       | Cumbersome; lacks precision                            |
| **Autopoietic**   | Rich theoretical history                      | Too obscure; often misunderstood in engineering contexts |
| **Meta-agent**    | Highlights self-observation or recursion      | “Meta” is overloaded and vague                         |
| **Creative agent**| Emphasizes novelty                            | Risks artistic connotation; lacks structural depth      |
| **Self-evolving** | Emphasizes long-term transformation           | Does not capture goal or logic generation               |

### Why *Autogenic* Works

The term *autogenic* strikes a balance across four axes:

- **Etymological clarity**: From *auto-* (self) and *-genic* (producing), it means “self-generating.”[^1][^5][^6]
- **Conceptual fit**: Captures both goal invention and architectural evolution.
- **Scientific precedent**: Used in biology and psychology to describe internally generated change[^2][^3].
- **Linguistic accessibility**: Intuitive for educated audiences without being vague or overly technical.

It is sufficiently distinct from “autonomous” to signal a **new conceptual boundary**, and grounded enough to carry formal weight in scientific discourse.

### Boxed Definition

> **Autogenic System**  
> A system capable of **generating its own goals, executable behaviors, and structural control logic** through self-orienting, self-programming, self-evolving, and self-reflective capabilities—without relying on externally defined templates or objectives.

## Implications and Applications

Autogenic systems introduce a new design paradigm: systems that do not merely execute or optimize tasks but **invent and restructure their own operational goals and strategies**. This has broad implications for autonomy, resilience, and the future of AI-native infrastructure.

### Engineering Significance

Autogenic systems enable capabilities essential in environments where:
- Predefined policies cannot cover all scenarios,
- Human intervention is impractical or delayed,
- System architectures must evolve alongside demands.

Such systems could operate in **unbounded or ill-defined problem spaces**, such as:
- Space exploration,
- Disaster response,
- Cognitive robotics,
- Self-designing digital infrastructure.

In each case, the ability to **invent new goals and reprogram behavior dynamically** offers an alternative to brittle, top-down control schemes.

### Use Case Examples

- **Digital Twins with Autogenic Planning**: A network digital twin that, when exposed to anomalous behavior, not only simulates countermeasures but invents a new monitoring strategy and deploys it.
- **Self-reprogramming Network Agents**: An AI agent embedded in a distributed 6G network detects novel latency patterns and creates new routing logic that had not been anticipated by original designers.
- **Cognitive AI Services**: A service that, after repeated failures to fulfill user intent, rewrites its own plan interpreter to better handle ambiguity and invents a fallback goal selection mechanism.

These are not adaptive systems in the traditional sense—they do not tune parameters or choose alternate paths. They **synthesize new paths** by revising their own definition of success.

### Scientific Value

Autogenic systems offer new ground for inquiry into:
- **Artificial general intelligence** (AGI)
- **Meta-cognition and reflection in agents**
- **Artificial life and self-sustaining systems**
- **Open-ended learning and internal goal emergence**

By creating systems that not only learn *how* to act, but *why* to act, autogenic intelligence **bridges behavior and purpose**—a hallmark of both living organisms and future intelligent agents.

### Summary Statement

Autogenic systems represent a necessary leap in the evolution of intelligent machines: from externally defined tools to **self-inventing, self-adaptive intelligences** that can navigate complexity not just with autonomy—but with **self-derived intent and logic**.
